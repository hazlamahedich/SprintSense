- Database connection errors
- Redis caching failures with fallback
- Invalid request validation
- Circuit breaker activation
- Large dataset handling

## üöÄ Running the Tests

### Quick Start
```bash
# From project root
cd backend
python scripts/run_ai_prioritization_tests.py

# Run specific test types
python scripts/run_ai_prioritization_tests.py unit
python scripts/run_ai_prioritization_tests.py integration  
python scripts/run_ai_prioritization_tests.py performance

# Run with coverage
python scripts/run_ai_prioritization_tests.py --coverage
```

### Manual Test Execution
```bash
# Unit tests only
pytest tests/unit/services/test_ai_prioritization_service.py -v

# Integration tests only
pytest tests/integration/api/test_ai_prioritization_api.py -v

# Performance tests only
pytest tests/performance/test_ai_prioritization_performance.py -v -s

# All AI prioritization tests
pytest -k "ai_prioritization" -v
```

## üìä Expected Test Results

### Unit Tests
- **25+ test methods** covering all service components
- **100% coverage** of critical code paths
- **Fast execution** (<30 seconds total)

### Integration Tests
- **15+ API test scenarios** with real HTTP requests
- **Database fixture** setup and teardown
- **Authentication flows** validated

### Performance Tests
- **10+ performance benchmarks** with timing assertions
- **Latency requirements** validated for various scenarios
- **Memory and concurrency** stress testing

## üîç Test Quality Assurance

### Test Design Principles
- **Isolation**: Each test is independent and can run alone
- **Repeatability**: Tests produce consistent results across runs  
- **Comprehensive**: Edge cases and error conditions covered
- **Realistic**: Test data mirrors production scenarios
- **Performance-aware**: Tests validate speed requirements

### Mock Strategy
- **Minimal mocking**: Only external dependencies mocked
- **Realistic responses**: Mock data matches production patterns
- **Error simulation**: Failure scenarios properly tested
- **State management**: Proper test setup and cleanup

## üéâ Summary

The AI Prioritization testing implementation provides:

1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Unit, integration, and performance tests
2. **Quality Assurance**: Robust error handling and edge case testing
3. **Performance Validation**: <500ms latency requirement enforcement
4. **Easy Execution**: Automated test runner with clear output
5. **Documentation**: Complete guide for running and extending tests
