# SprintSense Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Goals and Background Context

### Goals

  - Achieve 10 active pilot teams within the first 4 months.
  - Achieve a 20% improvement in sprint predictability for pilot teams.
  - Receive high user satisfaction scores for the core AI-powered features.
  - Increase participation rates in sprint planning and retrospective activities.
  - Establish a sustainable business model with growing MRR from premium features.

### Background Context

SprintSense is an open-source, AI-powered agile project management platform designed to move beyond the reactive, tracking-focused nature of traditional tools. It addresses key industry pain points, including the manual overhead of sprint planning, the lack of actionable insights from sprint data, and growing concerns over data privacy on cloud-based platforms. By providing predictive insights and intelligent automation in a self-hostable package, SprintSense aims to empower development teams to plan, execute, and learn from their sprints more effectively.

## 2. Requirements

### Functional Requirements

  - **FR1:** The system shall provide AI-powered backlog prioritization using multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) and allow for real-time re-ranking based on team input.
  - **FR2:** The system shall use NLP to analyze and cluster backlog items, suggesting logical groupings to the Product Owner.
  - **FR3:** The system shall incorporate a Monte Carlo simulation engine to provide **probabilistic guides, not deterministic forecasts,** for sprint outcomes, complete with confidence intervals to visually represent uncertainty.
  - **FR4:** The system shall analyze historical velocity and team capacity to inform sprint planning simulations. For new teams, the system will provide a "cold start" mode using industry-standard estimation models.
  - **FR5:** The system shall provide an AI-enhanced retrospective engine that performs sentiment analysis on feedback and identifies recurring patterns across sprints.
  - **FR6:** The system shall allow users to override AI-generated suggestions and decisions at any point in the workflow. The system should learn from these overrides to improve future recommendations.
  - **FR7:** All AI-generated recommendations must be accompanied by a "confidence score" and a brief, human-readable explanation of the factors that influenced the decision.
  - **FR8:** The application must include a dedicated "Data Management" section where users can export and delete their personal and team data.

### Non-Functional Requirements

  - **NFR1:** The platform must be self-hostable. The installation process must be scripted and achievable within 30 minutes by a user with basic command-line knowledge, and be accompanied by comprehensive documentation.
  - **NFR2:** All data in transit and at rest shall be secured with end-to-end encryption.
  - **NFR3:** The system shall provide role-based access control (RBAC) with auditable trails for all user actions.
  - **NFR4:** The system will be designed with an API-first approach. The initial API will be for internal use and subject to change, with a publicly documented and versioned API planned for a post-MVP release.
  - **NFR5:** The system must be compliant with GDPR, including data portability and deletion capabilities as specified in FR8.
  - **NFR6:** The platform must be scalable and performant, with a target of 99.9% uptime and average API response times under 200ms.

## 3. User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

The UI should be clean, intuitive, and data-rich, designed to build trust in the AI's recommendations while always keeping the user in control. It should feel like a collaborative partner that provides insightful suggestions, not a "black box" that dictates actions. We will adhere to a principle of **Progressive Disclosure**, ensuring the UI presents information only when it is contextually relevant to avoid overwhelming the user.

### Key Interaction Paradigms

  - **Suggest, Don't Command:** AI recommendations will be presented as non-intrusive, dismissible cards or overlays.
  - **Interactive Visualizations:** Key data visualizations will be interactive, allowing users to drill down into the underlying data.
  - **Teach the AI:** A consistent "override" or "teach" mechanism will be available for all AI features.
  - **Focus on One Thing at a Time:** The design will guide the user's attention to the most critical task or insight at any given moment.
  - **Configurable Assistance:** Users will be able to choose an "AI assistance level" (e.g., subtle, balanced, proactive) to match their preferences.

### Navigation

  - **Pattern:** A persistent vertical sidebar on the left-hand side will serve as the primary navigation for the application.
  - **Rationale:** This is a common and easily scalable pattern for applications with multiple top-level views like a Dashboard, Backlog, and Sprints.

### Styling

  - **Approach:** We will use MUI's built-in styling solution (`@mui/system`).
  - **Rationale:** This ensures maximum compatibility with the chosen component library and provides a consistent, themeable styling system out of the box.

### Component Library

  - **Library:** We will use **Material-UI (MUI)** as the primary component library.
  - **Rationale:** MUI provides a comprehensive set of well-tested, accessible, and professionally designed components that will significantly accelerate frontend development and ensure a consistent user experience.

### UI States

  - **Strategy:** A consistent strategy for handling UI states is required for all features.
  - **Loading State:** When data is being fetched, a loading indicator (e.g., a skeleton screen or a spinner) must be displayed.
  - **Empty State:** If a view contains no data (e.g., an empty backlog), a helpful message and a call-to-action (e.g., a "Create your first work item" button) must be displayed.
  - **Error State:** If an error occurs (e.g., a failed API call), a user-friendly error message and an option to retry the action must be displayed.

### Core Screens and Views

  - Dashboard, Backlog Management, Sprint Planning Simulation, Active Sprint Board, Retrospective Analysis.
  - **Note:** All screens with dense information will feature summary views with clear drill-down capabilities to manage complexity.

### Accessibility

  - **Target: WCAG 2.1 AA:** We will target WCAG 2.1 AA compliance.
  - **Commitment:** Accessibility will be a core requirement, included in the definition of "done" for all UI-related stories and tested continuously.

### Branding

  - **Goal:** The design process will focus on creating a unique and trustworthy brand identity that conveys intelligence, clarity, and collaboration.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

  - **Assumption:** The initial product will be a responsive web application, optimized for desktop use first.

---

## 4. Technical Assumptions

### Service Architecture: Modular Monolith

  - **Assumption:** For the MVP, we will build a "Modular Monolith" with strong internal boundaries between logical modules (e.g., `planning`, `prediction`, `analytics`).
  - **Rationale:** This provides clean separation of concerns without the high operational overhead of microservices, while allowing for future extraction.

### MVP Stack

  - **Backend:** FastAPI (using Python 3.11)
  - **Frontend:** React 18 (using Node.js 20) with TypeScript
  - **Database:** PostgreSQL 16
  - **AI/ML Pipeline:** Focus on `scikit-learn` and `spaCy` for the MVP.
  - **Asynchronous Tasks:** Use a library-based background task solution like Celery.
  - **Deployment:** Docker & Docker Compose

### Testing Requirements: Pragmatic Testing Strategy

  - **Assumption:** A strong focus on Unit and Integration tests, supplemented by a limited set of critical-path End-to-End (E2E) tests.
  - **Rationale:** This prioritizes development velocity while ensuring a high level of quality for the core logic.

### Frontend Development

  - **Component Development:** We will use **Storybook** to develop and document UI components in isolation.
  - **Rationale:** This will improve developer workflow, increase component reusability, and provide excellent documentation for the design system.
  - **Asset Optimization:** For the MVP, we will rely on the default asset optimization strategies provided by the **Vite** build process (e.g., code splitting, minification).
