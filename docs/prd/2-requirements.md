# 2. Requirements

## Functional Requirements

  - **FR1:** The system shall provide AI-powered backlog prioritization using multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) and allow for real-time re-ranking based on team input.
  - **FR2:** The system shall use NLP to analyze and cluster backlog items, suggesting logical groupings to the Product Owner.
  - **FR3:** The system shall incorporate a Monte Carlo simulation engine to provide **probabilistic guides, not deterministic forecasts,** for sprint outcomes, complete with confidence intervals to visually represent uncertainty.
  - **FR4:** The system shall analyze historical velocity and team capacity to inform sprint planning simulations. For new teams, the system will provide a "cold start" mode using industry-standard estimation models.
  - **FR5:** The system shall provide an AI-enhanced retrospective engine that performs sentiment analysis on feedback and identifies recurring patterns across sprints.
  - **FR6:** The system shall allow users to override AI-generated suggestions and decisions at any point in the workflow. The system should learn from these overrides to improve future recommendations.
  - **FR7:** All AI-generated recommendations must be accompanied by a "confidence score" and a brief, human-readable explanation of the factors that influenced the decision.
  - **FR8:** The application must include a dedicated "Data Management" section where users can export and delete their personal and team data.

## Non-Functional Requirements

  - **NFR1:** The platform must be self-hostable. The installation process must be scripted and achievable within 30 minutes by a user with basic command-line knowledge, and be accompanied by comprehensive documentation.
  - **NFR2:** All data in transit and at rest shall be secured with end-to-end encryption.
  - **NFR3:** The system shall provide role-based access control (RBAC) with auditable trails for all user actions.
  - **NFR4:** The system will be designed with an API-first approach. The initial API will be for internal use and subject to change, with a publicly documented and versioned API planned for a post-MVP release.
  - **NFR5:** The system must be compliant with GDPR, including data portability and deletion capabilities as specified in FR8.
  - **NFR6:** The platform must be scalable and performant, with a target of 99.9% uptime and average API response times under 200ms.
