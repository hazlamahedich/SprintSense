## Background Context

SprintSense is an open-source, AI-powered agile project management platform designed to move beyond the reactive, tracking-focused nature of traditional tools. It addresses key industry pain points, including the manual overhead of sprint planning, the lack of actionable insights from sprint data, and growing concerns over data privacy on cloud-based platforms. By providing predictive insights and intelligent automation in a self-hostable package, SprintSense aims to empower development teams to plan, execute, and learn from their sprints more effectively.
