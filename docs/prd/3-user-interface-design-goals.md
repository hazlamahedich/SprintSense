# 3. User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

The UI should be clean, intuitive, and data-rich, designed to build trust in the AI's recommendations while always keeping the user in control. It should feel like a collaborative partner that provides insightful suggestions, not a "black box" that dictates actions. We will adhere to a principle of **Progressive Disclosure**, ensuring the UI presents information only when it is contextually relevant to avoid overwhelming the user.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

* **Suggest, Don't Command:** AI recommendations will be presented as non-intrusive, dismissible cards or overlays.
* **Interactive Visualizations:** Key data visualizations will be interactive, allowing users to drill down into the underlying data.
* **Teach the AI:** A consistent "override" or "teach" mechanism will be available for all AI features.
* **Focus on One Thing at a Time:** The design will guide the user's attention to the most critical task or insight at any given moment.
* **Configurable Assistance:** Users will be able to choose an "AI assistance level" (e.g., subtle, balanced, proactive) to match their preferences.

## Navigation

* **Pattern:** A persistent vertical sidebar on the left-hand side will serve as the primary navigation for the application.
* **Rationale:** This is a common and easily scalable pattern for applications with multiple top-level views like a Dashboard, Backlog, and Sprints.

## Styling

* **Approach:** We will use MUI's built-in styling solution (`@mui/system`).
* **Rationale:** This ensures maximum compatibility with the chosen component library and provides a consistent, themeable styling system out of the box.

## Component Library

* **Library:** We will use **Material-UI (MUI)** as the primary component library.
* **Rationale:** MUI provides a comprehensive set of well-tested, accessible, and professionally designed components that will significantly accelerate frontend development and ensure a consistent user experience.

## UI States

* **Strategy:** A consistent strategy for handling UI states is required for all features.
* **Loading State:** When data is being fetched, a loading indicator (e.g., a skeleton screen or a spinner) must be displayed.
* **Empty State:** If a view contains no data (e.g., an empty backlog), a helpful message and a call-to-action (e.g., a "Create your first work item" button) must be displayed.
* **Error State:** If an error occurs (e.g., a failed API call), a user-friendly error message and an option to retry the action must be displayed.

## Core Screens and Views

* Dashboard, Backlog Management, Sprint Planning Simulation, Active Sprint Board, Retrospective Analysis.
* **Note:** All screens with dense information will feature summary views with clear drill-down capabilities to manage complexity.

## Accessibility

* **Target: WCAG 2.1 AA:** We will target WCAG 2.1 AA compliance.
* **Commitment:** Accessibility will be a core requirement, included in the definition of "done" for all UI-related stories and tested continuously.

## Branding

* **Goal:** The design process will focus on creating a unique and trustworthy brand identity that conveys intelligence, clarity, and collaboration.

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

* **Assumption:** The initial product will be a responsive web application, optimized for desktop use first.
