* This story was added to enhance AI capabilities beyond initial scope
* Impacts need to be carefully managed

## Acceptance Criteria
1. [ ] AC1: Requires documented approval from Product Owner
2. [ ] AC2: Must not compromise existing AI features (3.1-3.4)
3. [ ] AC3: Technical architecture review completed
4. [ ] AC4: Performance impact assessed and documented
5. [ ] AC5: Integration tests with existing stories completed

## Dependencies
* Story 3.1: Manage Project Goals
* Story 3.2: AI Prioritization Service
* Story 3.3: Review and Apply AI Suggestions
* Story 3.4: Suggest and Create Epics from Clusters

## Implementation Requirements
