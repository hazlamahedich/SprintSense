# Story 3.5 Mitigation Strategy

## Overview
This document outlines the strategies to mitigate risks and challenges identified in the impact assessment for Story 3.5's addition to Epic 3.

## 1. Schedule Impact Mitigation

### Timeline Adjustments
* Implement phased delivery approach
* Break Story 3.5 into smaller, manageable sub-tasks
* Identify parallel work opportunities
* Buffer time added to subsequent epic timelines

### Resource Allocation
* Redistribute team workload
* Identify external resource needs early
* Plan for temporary capacity reduction
* Cross-training opportunities identified

## 2. Technical Risk Mitigation

### Architecture
* Review and enhance current AI/ML architecture
* Implement feature toggles for gradual rollout
* Plan for horizontal scaling
* Define clear integration boundaries

### Performance
* Establish performance benchmarks
* Implement monitoring early
* Plan for caching strategies
* Define scaling thresholds

### Technical Debt
* Code review guidelines updated
* Documentation requirements enhanced
* Regular technical debt review sessions
* Automated testing requirements increased

## 3. Quality Gates

### Development Phase
* Enhanced code review process
* Architecture review requirements
* Performance testing requirements
* Security review requirements

### Testing Phase
* Additional test coverage requirements
* Performance test criteria
