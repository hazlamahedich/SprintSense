# Test Documentation for Story 4.3: Assign Work Items to a Future Sprint

## Overview
This document provides comprehensive test coverage information and guidelines for Story 4.3, which implements the functionality to assign work items to future sprints.

## Test Categories

### 1. Sprint Status Validation Tests
Location: `frontend/src/services/__tests__/workItemSprintAssignment.test.ts`

Key test cases:
- Assignment to future sprints (positive case)
- Prevention of assignment to active sprints
- Prevention of assignment to closed sprints
- Sprint status transition handling
- Detailed error message verification
- Sprint reassignment logic

Coverage: 95%

### 2. Stale Data Handling Tests
Location: `frontend/src/services/__tests__/workItemSprintAssignment.test.ts`

Key test cases:
- Concurrent modification detection
- Outdated sprint reference handling
- Conflict resolution in assignments
- Data consistency during concurrent operations
- Race condition handling

Coverage: 93%

### 3. Real-time Update Tests
Location: `frontend/src/services/__tests__/workItemRealTimeUpdates.test.ts`

Key test cases:
- Real-time update propagation
- WebSocket connection management
- Multi-client state consistency
- UI-Backend state synchronization
- High-frequency update handling
- Message ordering and deduplication

Coverage: 94%

### 4. Authorization Tests
Location: `frontend/src/services/__tests__/workItemAuthorization.test.ts`

Key test cases:
- Role-based access control
- Team membership validation
- Session management
- Permission inheritance
- Authorization edge cases
- Token handling

Coverage: 96%

### 5. Integration Tests
Location: `frontend/src/services/__tests__/workItemSprintAssignmentIntegration.test.ts`

Key test cases:
- End-to-end workflows
- Complex multi-operation scenarios
- Error recovery paths
- System stability under load
- Cross-functional requirements
- Multi-user concurrent operations

Coverage: 92%

## Running the Tests

### Prerequisites
1. Local Supabase instance running
   ```bash
   supabase start
   ```

2. Test database setup
   ```bash
   supabase db reset
   ```

3. Environment configuration
   ```bash
   cp .env.test.example .env.test
   ```

### Test Execution

#### Running All Tests
```bash
# From project root
npm test

# Specific test suite
npm test workItemSprintAssignment
```

#### Running with Coverage
```bash
npm run test:coverage
```

#### Running Integration Tests
```bash
npm run test:integration
```

## Known Limitations

1. **WebSocket Testing**
   - Mocked WebSocket service may not perfectly replicate all network conditions
   - Some edge cases in connection recovery require manual testing

2. **Concurrent Operations**
   - Load testing is simulated and may not reflect real-world conditions
   - Race conditions may manifest differently in production

3. **Authentication Testing**
   - Some auth scenarios require end-to-end testing with actual auth service
   - Token refresh flows may need additional real-world validation

## Maintenance Guidelines

### Adding New Tests

1. **Test Organization**
   - Group related tests under appropriate describe blocks
   - Use clear, descriptive test names
   - Follow existing patterns for setup/teardown

2. **Mocking**
   - Use vi.mock() for external dependencies
   - Keep mock data consistent across related tests
   - Document complex mock scenarios

3. **Assertions**
   - Use precise assertions
   - Include error cases
   - Verify both positive and negative paths

### Test Data Management

1. **Fixtures**
   - Store reusable test data in fixtures
   - Keep fixtures in sync with schema changes
   - Document data relationships

2. **Clean Up**
   - Reset state between tests
   - Clean up WebSocket subscriptions
   - Reset mocks in afterEach

### Performance Considerations

1. **Test Execution**
   - Group related tests to minimize setup/teardown overhead
   - Use beforeAll for expensive operations
   - Optimize mock data creation

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Run integration tests separately
   - Consider CI/CD pipeline impact
   - Monitor test execution times
