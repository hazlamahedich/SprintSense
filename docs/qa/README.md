# QA Documentation

## Overview

This directory contains Quality Assurance (QA) documentation for the SprintSense project, including QA gate documents that must be completed before any production deployment.

## Purpose

The QA gate process ensures that:

- All features meet defined acceptance criteria
- Code quality standards are maintained
- Security requirements are satisfied
- Performance benchmarks are met
- User experience standards are upheld
- Documentation is complete and accurate

## QA Gate Process

### 1. Story Implementation

- Development completes all tasks defined in the story
- All unit and integration tests pass
- Code review is completed

### 2. QA Gate Execution

- QA Agent/Lead creates a QA gate document using the template
- Comprehensive testing is performed across all categories
- Results are documented with pass/fail status for each checkpoint

### 3. Decision Making

- **APPROVED**: All critical checkpoints pass, feature is cleared for deployment
- **NEEDS REVISION**: Minor issues identified, specific fixes required
- **REJECTED**: Major issues found, significant rework needed

### 4. Deployment Authorization

- Only features with "APPROVED" QA status can proceed to production
- Deployment must include the completed QA gate document
- Post-deployment verification must be completed

## Document Types

### QA Gate Documents

Individual QA gate documents for each story/feature:

- `qa-gate-story-X.Y-feature-name.md`
- Complete verification of all quality aspects
- Pass/fail status for each checkpoint
- Final approval/rejection decision

### QA Gate Template

- `qa-gate-template.md`
- Standard template for creating new QA gate documents
- Ensures consistency across all QA processes
- Must be used for every new feature/story

## QA Categories

### 1. Test Execution

- **Backend Testing**: Unit tests, integration tests, security tests
- **Frontend Testing**: Component tests, integration tests, E2E tests
- **Performance Testing**: Load testing, stress testing, optimization validation

### 2. Functional Verification

- **Acceptance Criteria**: All story requirements met
- **Happy Path**: Primary user workflows function correctly
- **Error Paths**: Edge cases and error conditions handled appropriately

### 3. Security Assessment

- **Authentication/Authorization**: Access controls working correctly
- **Input Validation**: All inputs properly validated and sanitized
- **Data Protection**: Sensitive data handled securely

### 4. User Experience

- **Usability**: Interface intuitive and user-friendly
- **Accessibility**: WCAG compliance and inclusive design
- **Responsive Design**: Works across all device types and screen sizes

### 5. Code Quality

- **Architecture Compliance**: Follows established patterns and standards
- **Documentation**: Code comments, API docs, user guides complete
- **Maintainability**: Code is clean, readable, and well-structured

### 6. Deployment Readiness

- **Environment Preparation**: All configurations validated
- **Rollback Procedures**: Backup and recovery plans tested
- **Monitoring**: Alerts and logging configured appropriately

## Quality Standards

### Test Coverage Requirements

- **Backend**: Minimum 80% code coverage
- **Frontend**: Minimum 70% code coverage
- **Critical Paths**: 100% coverage for core business logic

### Performance Benchmarks

- **API Response Time**: < 200ms for standard operations
- **Frontend Load Time**: < 3 seconds initial load
- **Database Queries**: Optimized with proper indexing

### Security Standards

- **Authentication**: Required for all protected resources
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs validated and sanitized
- **Error Handling**: No sensitive information exposed in errors

### Browser Support

- Chrome (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Edge (latest)
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)

## Tools and Automation

### Testing Frameworks

- **Backend**: Pytest (Python), comprehensive test suites
- **Frontend**: Vitest, React Testing Library
- **Integration**: Custom test utilities and fixtures

### Code Quality Tools

- **Linting**: ESLint (frontend), Flake8/Black (backend)
- **Type Checking**: TypeScript (frontend), mypy (Python)
- **Security Scanning**: Automated vulnerability detection

### CI/CD Integration

- All QA checks run automatically in CI pipeline
- Manual QA gate approval required before production deployment
- Post-deployment verification automated where possible

## Usage Instructions

### For QA Agents/Leads

1. **Create QA Gate Document**:

   ```bash
   cp docs/qa/qa-gate-template.md docs/qa/qa-gate-story-X.Y-feature-name.md
   ```

2. **Complete All Sections**:
   - Fill in document information
   - Execute all test categories
   - Document results with checkboxes
   - Provide final assessment and sign-off

3. **Review and Approve**:
   - Verify all critical checkpoints pass
   - Document any issues or recommendations
   - Make final approval/rejection decision

### For Developers

1. **Pre-QA Checklist**:
   - All story tasks completed
   - All tests passing locally
   - Code review completed
   - Documentation updated

2. **Support QA Process**:
   - Provide test environment setup
   - Answer questions about implementation
   - Address any issues identified in QA

3. **Post-QA Actions**:
   - Fix any issues if QA status is "NEEDS REVISION"
   - Proceed with deployment only after QA approval
   - Complete post-deployment verification

## Compliance and Governance

### Rule Adherence

- **Rule ktlFUZTBDGfzx5bGDaUqew**: Only run full CI/CD workflow after QA approval
- **Rule BC73BsemmfLkKZmGzdCOY0**: Always check against coding standards
- **Rule hEnxrmj2UTFwjHP7eSoPTl**: Update changelogs when documents are modified

### Audit Trail

- All QA gate documents are version controlled
- Changes tracked through Git history
- Deployment decisions documented with rationale

### Continuous Improvement

- QA processes reviewed and updated regularly
- Feedback incorporated from development team
- Templates updated based on lessons learned
