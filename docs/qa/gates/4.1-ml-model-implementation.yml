  - "Add performance tuning guide"
  - "Document model behavior patterns"
  - "Add troubleshooting guide"

notes: |
  All tests passing with comprehensive coverage across all components.
  - Pattern recognition model successfully detects multiple patterns
  - Priority prediction provides accurate scoring with team context
  - Circuit breaker implementation protects against failures
  - Error handling is robust and properly tested
  - Logging format standardized with proper JSON structures
  - Code quality meets all standards
  Story ready for production deployment.
