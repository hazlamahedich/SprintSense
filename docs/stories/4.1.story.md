## Dev Notes

### Model Architecture

**Pattern Recognition Model:**
```python
class PatternRecognitionModel:
    def __init__(self):
        self.transformer = AutoModel.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")
        self.classifier = MultiLabelClassifier(
            input_dim=768,
            hidden_dim=256,
            num_labels=len(PATTERN_LABELS)
        )
        
    def forward(self, text):
        embeddings = self.transformer(text).last_hidden_state[:, 0]
        patterns = self.classifier(embeddings)
        return patterns, self.compute_confidence(patterns)
```

**Priority Prediction Model:**
```python
class PriorityPredictionModel:
    def __init__(self):
        self.model = XGBRegressor(
            objective="reg:squarederror",
            max_depth=6,
            learning_rate=0.1,
            n_estimators=100
        )
        
    def predict(self, features):
        priority = self.model.predict(features)
        confidence = self.compute_prediction_confidence(features)
        return priority, confidence
```

### Feature Engineering

**Text Features:**
```python
def extract_text_features(text):
    return {
        'embeddings': get_bert_embeddings(text),
        'key_phrases': extract_key_phrases(text),
        'technical_complexity': estimate_complexity(text),
        'domain_keywords': extract_domain_terms(text)
    }
```

**Historical Features:**
```python
def extract_historical_features(team_id, item_type):
    return {
        'team_velocity': compute_team_velocity(team_id),
        'type_completion_time': avg_completion_time(team_id, item_type),
        'similar_items_priority': get_similar_items_priority(item_type),
        'team_capacity': get_team_capacity(team_id)
    }
```

### Performance Optimizations

1. Caching Strategy:
```python
@cache(ttl=300)  # 5-minute cache
def get_model_predictions(text, team_id):
    try:
        return model_service.predict(text, team_id)
    except ModelServiceError:
        return fallback_rule_based_prediction(text, team_id)
```

2. Batch Processing:
```python
def batch_predict(items, batch_size=32):
    return [
        process_batch(items[i:i + batch_size])
        for i in range(0, len(items), batch_size)
    ]
```

### Monitoring Setup

**Metrics Collection:**
```python
def log_model_metrics(prediction, actual):
    metrics.log(
        name="model_performance",
        labels={
            "model_version": CURRENT_VERSION,
            "team_id": prediction.team_id
        },
        values={
            "prediction_confidence": prediction.confidence,
            "latency_ms": prediction.latency,
            "accuracy": compute_accuracy(prediction, actual)
        }
    )
```

**Alert Rules:**
```yaml
alerts:
  - name: high_latency
    condition: latency_p95 > 200ms
    duration: 5m
  - name: low_accuracy
    condition: accuracy_rolling_24h < 0.80
    duration: 1h
  - name: prediction_drift
    condition: distribution_kl_divergence > 0.3
    duration: 6h
```

### Rollout Strategy

1. Shadow Mode Phase:
   - Deploy models in parallel
   - Store prediction pairs
   - Analyze accuracy differences
   - No impact on production

2. A/B Testing Phase:
   - Select test teams

### Error Handling Test Cases

1. Model Errors:
   ```gherkin
   Scenario: Model service unavailable
   Given the ML service is down
   When a prediction request is made
   Then the system falls back to rule-based prediction
   And users are notified appropriately
   And the incident is logged

   Scenario: Low confidence prediction
   Given a work item with unclear patterns
   When the model generates predictions
   Then low confidence is clearly indicated
   And alternative suggestions are provided
   ```

2. Data Pipeline Errors:
   ```gherkin
   Scenario: Feature extraction failure
   Given a corrupted work item description
   When feature extraction runs
   Then partial features are used
   And degraded service is indicated

   Scenario: Historical data unavailable
   Given the feature store is unreachable
   When predictions are requested
   Then cached features are used
   And staleness is indicated
   ```
