# Story 4.5: Definition of Done Implementation

## Status
Current Status: Done ✅
QA Status: ✅ PASSED

## Story
**As a** team member,
**I want** to mark a work item as "Done,"
**so that** we can track our progress and calculate velocity

## Business Value
- Enables accurate velocity tracking for better sprint planning
- Provides clear visibility of sprint progress
- Facilitates data-driven process improvements through completion metrics
- Ensures consistent "Definition of Done" across the team

## Acceptance Criteria

### Technical Requirements
- [x] Moving card to "Done" column updates the work item status in the database within 500ms
- [x] `completion_date` field is recorded with current timestamp (UTC) when status changes to "Done"
- [ ] Story points are included in velocity calculations with 100% accuracy
- [ ] Status updates are reflected in real-time for all users within 1 second
- [x] All status changes are validated against the allowed state transition matrix
- [x] Database constraints prevent invalid state transitions

### Business Requirements
- [ ] Team velocity calculations are accurate and updated immediately when stories are marked as done
- [ ] Historical completion data is preserved for reporting and trend analysis
- [ ] Status changes are tracked in the audit log with user attribution
- [ ] Sprint burndown charts update in real-time with completion status
- [ ] Completion metrics can be exported for team retrospectives

### User Experience Requirements
- [x] Status change is visually clear and immediate
