# Story 1.6: Team Creation

## Status

Approved

## Story

**As a** logged-in user,
**I want** to create a new team with a unique name,
**so that** I can organize my work effectively.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A new database migration is created for the `teams` table.
2. "Create Team" form exists and is accessible to authenticated users.
3. The system handles duplicate team names for the same user by showing an error message.

## Dev Notes

### Data Models

- The `Team` model has attributes: `id` (UUID), `name` (string), `created_at` (Date), `updated_at` (Date)
- The `TeamMember` model connects users to teams with attributes: `id` (UUID), `teamId` (FK), `userId` (FK), `role` (enum: 'owner', 'member'), `created_at` (Date)
- Teams are owned by users through the team_members relationship with 'owner' role
- *[Source: docs/architecture/4-data-models.md]*

### API Specifications

- Team creation will be handled via a `POST /api/v1/teams` endpoint
- Authentication will continue using secure, HTTP-only cookies from Story 1.5
- Request body: `{ "name": "string" }`
- Response: Full team object with owner relationship
- *[Source: docs/architecture/5-api-specification.md]*

### Backend Architecture

- Team creation logic will be part of a new `TeamService` module
- A new `teams.py` router will be created under `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/`
- The Repository Pattern will be used for all database interactions
- Dependency injection pattern will be followed for service layer
- *[Source: docs/architecture/10-backend-architecture.md]*

### Frontend Architecture

- A new `CreateTeamPage.tsx` will be created under `frontend/src/pages/`
- Team state will be managed by extending the existing Zustand store
- API calls will be handled in the dedicated service layer
- Form validation will use React Hook Form with MUI components
- UI styling: Follow MUI theme customizations from coding standards (custom indigo/amber palette)
- Responsive design: Form adapts to mobile (single column) and desktop (centered card layout)
- *[Source: docs/architecture/9-frontend-architecture.md]*

### File Locations

- Team API Endpoints: `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/teams.py`
- Team Service: `backend/app/services/team_service.py` (new)
- Team Repository: `backend/app/repositories/team_repository.py` (new)
- Create Team Page: `frontend/src/pages/CreateTeamPage.tsx`
- Team Dashboard: `frontend/src/pages/TeamDashboard.tsx` (placeholder)
- Database Migration: `backend/alembic/versions/{timestamp}_add_teams_and_team_members_tables.py`
- Backend Unit Tests: `backend/tests/unit/test_team_service.py`
- Backend Integration Tests: `backend/tests/integration/test_teams_api.py`
- Frontend Component Tests: `frontend/src/pages/__tests__/CreateTeamPage.test.tsx`
- Frontend Navigation Tests: `frontend/src/__tests__/teamNavigation.test.tsx`
- *[Source: docs/architecture/11-unified-project-structure.md]*

### Database

- PostgreSQL database with new `teams` and `team_members` tables
- UUID primary keys following established patterns
- Foreign key relationships between users and teams
- Database migrations managed via Alembic (established in Story 1.2)
- *[Source: docs/architecture/3-tech-stack.md, docs/architecture/4-data-models.md]*

### Security

- Team creation requires authentication (reuse existing auth middleware)
- Input validation for team names (required, min 1 char, max 100 chars, sanitization)
- Rate limiting: 10 team creations per user per hour (prevent abuse)
- Authorization: only team owners can perform team management actions
- SQL injection prevention via parameterized queries (Repository Pattern)
- *[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#security-best-practices]*

### Testing Requirements

- Backend: Pytest unit tests for `TeamService` and integration tests for `/api/v1/teams` endpoints
- Frontend: Vitest/React Testing Library tests for `CreateTeamPage` component, mocking API calls
- Test coverage: 80% for backend, 70% for frontend
- Test duplicate name validation, form validation, error handling
- Test data setup: Create test user via existing auth fixtures from Story 1.5
- Integration tests use test database with applied migrations
- Mock authentication context for frontend tests
- *[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#testing-requirements]*

### Previous Story Context

- Story 1.4 established user registration and database user model
- Story 1.5 implemented authentication with secure HTTP-only cookies
- Authentication middleware and user session management patterns are established and should be reused
- *[Source: stories/1.5.user_login_and_logout.md]*
