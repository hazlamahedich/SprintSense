- Consider using Graph Neural Networks for complex chains
- Optimize for both accuracy and inference speed

### Technical Dependencies
1. ML Infrastructure:
   - TensorFlow 2.x or PyTorch 1.x
   - Graph database for dependency storage
   - Vector similarity service
   - Model serving infrastructure

2. Frontend Components:
   - D3.js or Cytoscape.js for visualizations
   - React for UI components
   - Redux/Context for state management
   - WebSocket for real-time updates

### Test Scenarios

```gherkin
Scenario: Detect Critical Path Dependencies
Given a set of work items with known dependencies
When the ML model analyzes the items
Then it identifies critical path items with >= 80% precision
And highlights blocking dependencies in the visualization

Scenario: Handle Concurrent Dependency Updates
Given multiple users are editing dependencies
When they make conflicting changes
Then the system maintains data consistency
And shows appropriate conflict resolution UI
And logs all conflict events

Scenario: Recover from Service Interruption
Given the dependency service becomes unavailable
When users attempt to view or modify dependencies
Then the system falls back to basic rules within 100ms
And maintains read-only access to existing dependencies
And automatically recovers when service restores
```

Additional test cases to be developed during implementation phase
