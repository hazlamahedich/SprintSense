  - [x] Write integration tests for RBAC system
  - [x] Write integration tests for security monitoring

## Dev Notes
This story involves implementing security measures for our LLM integration. Based on the architecture documents:

**Data Security Requirements:**
[Source: architecture/security/llm-security.md]
- All LLM API keys must be stored in AWS Secrets Manager
- PII detection must use approved libraries (AWS Comprehend or equivalent)
- All requests must be logged with request ID, timestamp, and user context
- Compliance monitoring must track usage patterns and anomalies

**Access Control Requirements:**
[Source: architecture/security/rbac.md]
- Teams must have configurable API usage quotas
- RBAC must integrate with existing authentication system
- Quota tracking must be real-time with Redis caching
- Role hierarchy must support admin, team-admin, and user levels

**Monitoring Requirements:**
[Source: architecture/security/monitoring.md]
- Security events must be logged to dedicated security log stream
- Compliance dashboard must show key metrics:
  - API usage by team
  - PII detection events
  - Key rotation status
  - Security alerts

### Testing
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Test files should be located in `/tests/security/`
- Unit tests required for all security-critical functions
- Integration tests must verify end-to-end security flows
- Security tests must be isolated from other test suites
- Mock responses required for all external service calls
