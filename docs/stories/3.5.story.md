# Story 3.5: AI-Powered Work Item Recommendations

## Status
Done ✅

## Story
**As a** team member using the AI prioritization system,
**I want** to receive intelligent recommendations for new work items based on existing backlog patterns, team velocity, and historical success metrics,
**so that** I can proactively identify high-value work items that increase team efficiency and delivery predictability.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. System analyzes existing backlog patterns (work item types, descriptions, priorities) and completed work items' success metrics to generate contextually relevant recommendations
2. Recommendations include title, description, type, and estimated priority (using Story 3.2's priority scoring model) with confidence levels for each field
3. User interface provides a "Recommendations" section in the backlog view with clear differentiation from regular work items and displays expected business value indicators (e.g., estimated story points, completion time)
4. Each recommendation has "Accept", "Modify", and "Not Useful" actions - accept creates a new work item, modify opens a pre-filled creation form, and "Not Useful" provides feedback to improve future recommendations
5. AI model considers team velocity, current sprint capacity, and historical completion patterns when suggesting new work items to maintain realistic delivery expectations
6. System provides clear explanation for each recommendation, including patterns identified, reasoning, and specific success metrics from similar past work items
7. Performance impact on backlog view is minimal (<500ms additional load time) with proper loading states
8. Error handling includes graceful degradation when AI service is unavailable, showing clear user feedback
9. System tracks acceptance rate and usefulness feedback of recommendations to demonstrate improvement in suggestion quality over time

### Technical Constraints

**Frontend Requirements:**
- TypeScript with strict null checks
- Function components only
- Custom hooks for AI data fetching
- Proper error boundaries and loading states
- Maximum 500ms load time for recommendations
- Graceful degradation without AI service

**Backend Requirements:**
- Full type annotations
- FastAPI dependency injection
- Comprehensive error handling
- Caching for AI responses (5 minute TTL)
- Circuit breaker pattern for AI service
- 95th percentile response time <200ms

### Testing Strategy
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]

**Backend Test Coverage:**
- API endpoint tests with all status codes
- Service layer unit tests with mocks
- Performance testing with large datasets
- Chaos testing for network failures

**Frontend Test Coverage:**
- Component rendering tests
- Hook behavior tests
- Service integration tests
- End-to-end user flows

**Critical Test Scenarios:**
```gherkin
Scenario: Quality metrics under load
  Given the quality metrics endpoint
  When receiving 50 concurrent requests
  Then 95% of responses complete within 200ms
  And no errors are returned

Scenario: Network resilience
  Given the metrics service is experiencing issues
  When requesting quality metrics
  Then cached data is returned if available
  And appropriate error messages are shown
```

### ML Implementation Status

**Currently Mocked Components:**
1. Pattern Recognition Model:
   - Current: Rule-based pattern matching using regex and keyword analysis
   - Input: Work item title, description, and type
   - Output: List of identified patterns (e.g., "auth-related", "user-facing", "performance")
   - Confidence: Calculated based on keyword match strength (0.6-0.9 range)
   - Limitations: Cannot identify complex patterns or learn from feedback

2. Priority Prediction Algorithm:
   - Current: Weighted scoring based on static rules
   - Inputs: Item type, patterns matched, team velocity
   - Output: Priority score (0-1) and confidence level
   - Rules:
     ```python
     def mock_priority_score(item):
         base_score = 0.5
         if "user-facing" in item.patterns:
             base_score += 0.2
         if "performance" in item.patterns:
             base_score += 0.15
         if item.type == "bug":
             base_score += 0.1
         return min(base_score, 1.0)
     ```

**Transition Plan to Production ML Models:**

1. Data Collection Phase (Current):
   - Collecting user feedback on recommendations
   - Tracking acceptance rates and reasons
   - Building historical pattern database
   - Monitoring prediction accuracy metrics

2. Model Development (Future Story):
   - Pattern Recognition:
     - Use transformers-based model for text analysis
     - Train on historical work items and feedback
     - Support multi-label classification for patterns
     - Enable continuous learning from feedback

   - Priority Prediction:
     - Implement gradient boosting model (XGBoost)
     - Features: text embeddings, historical metrics, team velocity
     - Target: normalized priority scores with confidence
     - Support online learning for continuous improvement

3. Transition Strategy:
   ```mermaid
   graph TD
     A[Mocked Implementation] --> B[Shadow Mode]
     B --> C[A/B Testing]
     C --> D[Gradual Rollout]
     D --> E[Full Production]

     subgraph "Phase 1: Shadow Mode"
     B
     F[Collect Prediction Pairs]
     G[Compare Accuracy]
     end

     subgraph "Phase 2: A/B Testing"
     C
     H[Monitor Metrics]
     I[Gather Feedback]
     end

     subgraph "Phase 3: Rollout"
     D
     J[Team by Team]
     K[Monitor Success]
     end
   ```

4. Migration Steps:
   - Deploy ML models in shadow mode alongside mocked versions
   - Compare predictions and collect accuracy metrics
   - Run A/B tests with select teams
   - Gradually roll out to all teams
   - Maintain fallback to mocked versions

5. Success Metrics:
   - Prediction accuracy > 80%
   - Acceptance rate improvement > 15%
   - Response time < 200ms (95th percentile)
   - Resource usage within budget
