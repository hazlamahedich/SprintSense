# Story 4.2: Sprint Lifecycle Management

## Status
ðŸ”„ Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** Product Owner,
**I want** to manage the lifecycle of a sprint with clear rules,
**so that** I can control the flow of work without causing confusion.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Prevents overlapping sprint dates. Sprints are considered overlapping if their date ranges intersect (inclusive of start and end dates).
2. "Start Sprint" button is disabled if a sprint is already active.
3. States are limited to `Future`, `Active`, and `Closed`. Valid transitions are `Future` -> `Active` and `Active` -> `Closed`. All other attempted transitions are invalid and should be rejected by the API.
4. UI clearly displays the current state of each sprint.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] **Backend**
- [x] **API:** Create a new `sprints` table migration based on the `Sprint` data model.
        - [x] Include fields for `id`, `team_id`, `name`, `status`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `goal`.
        - [x] The `status` field should be an enum with values: `future`, `active`, `closed`.
    - [x] **API:** Develop API endpoints for sprint management (`/teams/{team_id}/sprints`).
        - [x] `POST /sprints`: Create a new sprint. Add validation to prevent overlapping sprint dates for the same team.
        - [x] `PATCH /sprints/{sprint_id}`: Update a sprint's status. Enforce valid state transitions (`Future` -> `Active`, `Active` -> `Closed`).
        - [x] `GET /sprints`: List all sprints for a team.
    - [x] **Business Logic:** Implement the state transition logic in the `Backlog & Sprint Service`.
        - [x] Only one sprint can be `active` at a time per team.
- [x] **Frontend**
    - [x] **UI:** Create a new UI view for sprint management.
    - [x] **UI:** Display the list of sprints with their current status.
    - [x] **UI:** Implement a "Start Sprint" button.
        - [x] The button should be disabled if another sprint is already active.
        - [x] Clicking the button should call the `PATCH /sprints/{sprint_id}` endpoint to update the status to `active`.
    - [x] **State Management:** Use Zustand to manage the state of sprints in the frontend.
- [ ] **Testing**
- [x] **Backend Unit Tests:**
        - [x] Test that creating a sprint with overlapping dates returns an error.
        - [x] Test that attempting to start a sprint when another is already active returns an error.
        - [x] Test valid state transitions (`Future` -> `Active`, `Active` -> `Closed`).
        - [x] Test that invalid state transitions (e.g., `Future` -> `Closed`) are rejected.
- [x] **Frontend Component Tests:**
        - [x] Test that the "Start Sprint" button is disabled when a sprint is active.
        - [x] Test that the UI correctly displays the status of each sprint.
    - [ ] **E2E Tests:**
        - [ ] Create an end-to-end test for the entire sprint lifecycle: create, start, and close a sprint.

## Dev Notes
### Data Models
- **Sprint Model:**
    - `id`: UUID
    - `teamId`: FK to Team
    - `name`: string
    - `status`: enum ('future', 'active', 'closed')
    - `startDate`: Date
    - `endDate`: Date
    - `goal`: string
    - [Source: `docs/architecture/4-data-models.md`]

### API Specifications
- **Endpoints:**
    - `POST /teams/{team_id}/sprints`
    - `PATCH /teams/{team_id}/sprints/{sprint_id}`
    - `GET /teams/{team_id}/sprints`
- **Authentication:** Secure, HTTP-only cookies.
- [Source: `docs/architecture/5-api-specification.md`]

### Backend Architecture
- **Pattern:** Modular Monolith with Repository Pattern.
- **Service:** All business logic should be implemented in the `Backlog & Sprint Service`.
- [Source: `docs/architecture/10-backend-architecture.md`, `docs/architecture/6-components.md`]

### Frontend Architecture
- **State Management:** Zustand
- **API Communication:** Dedicated service layer.
- [Source: `docs/architecture/9-frontend-architecture.md`]

### Testing
- **Backend:**
    - Use `pytest`.
    - Test file location: `backend/tests/`.
    - Test file naming: `test_*.py`.
- **Frontend:**
    - Use `vitest`.
    - Test file location: `frontend/src/__tests__/`.
    - Test file naming: `*.test.ts[x]`.
- [Source: `docs/architecture/coding-standards.md`]

## QA Testing Steps
1. Sprint Creation:
   - Create a new sprint with valid dates
   - Verify validation for overlapping dates
   - Check empty state handling

2. State Transitions:
   - Start a future sprint when no active sprint exists
   - Verify "Start Sprint" is disabled when another sprint is active
   - Try to start a closed sprint (should be disabled)
   - Close an active sprint
   - Try invalid transitions (should be prevented)

3. UI/UX:
   - Verify status badges show correct colors
   - Check loading states during API calls
   - Verify error messages are clear and helpful
   - Test responsive layout on different screen sizes

4. Edge Cases:
   - Test with many sprints (pagination/scrolling)
   - Test with long sprint names/descriptions
   - Verify proper handling of network errors
   - Check state consistency after page refresh
