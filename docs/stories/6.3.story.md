- Reduce sprint planning meeting duration (Target: 20% reduction while maintaining quality)
- Improve sprint success rate (Target: 25% increase in commitments met)
- Enhance decision-making confidence (Target: 90% of users report increased confidence)
- Support iterative planning (Target: Average 3+ simulation runs per sprint)
- Foster team collaboration (Target: 80% of team members actively participate)
- Drive data-driven decisions (Target: 95% of changes based on simulation feedback)

## Technical Notes

### Component Architecture
```tsx
// Interactive Sprint Planning Container
const InteractiveSprintPlanning: React.FC = () => {
  const [items, setItems] = useState<WorkItem[]>([]);
  const debouncedSimulation = useCallback(
    debounce(runSimulation, 500),
    []
  );
  
  return (
    <DndProvider>
      <SimulationContext.Provider value={{ items, updateItems }}>
        <BacklogList />
        <SprintPlanningBoard />
        <SimulationResults />
      </SimulationContext.Provider>
    </DndProvider>
  );
};

// Draggable Work Item Component
const DraggableWorkItem: React.FC<{item: WorkItem}> = ({item}) => {
  const [{ isDragging }, drag] = useDrag({
    type: 'WORK_ITEM',
    item: { id: item.id },
    collect: monitor => ({
      isDragging: monitor.isDragging(),
    }),
  });

  return (
    <div ref={drag} className={isDragging ? 'dragging' : ''}>
      <WorkItemCard item={item} />
    </div>
  );
};
```

### State Management
```typescript
interface SimulationState {
  items: WorkItem[];
  results: SimulationResult | null;
  isLoading: boolean;
  error: Error | null;
}

interface SimulationActions {
  addItem: (item: WorkItem) => void;
  removeItem: (id: string) => void;
  updateResults: (results: SimulationResult) => void;
}
```

### Performance Optimizations
1. Debounce simulation requests
2. Memoize expensive calculations
3. Virtualize large lists
4. Optimize re-renders
5. Cache simulation results
