## Story
**As a** scrum master or team lead,
**I want** automated analysis of sprint balance and workload distribution,
**So that** we can ensure our sprints are well-balanced and achievable, preventing team burnout and improving delivery predictability.

## Business Value
- Prevent sprint overcommitment through early detection (Target: Reduce overcommitment incidents by 80%)
- Improve sprint success rate with balanced workload (Target: Increase sprint completion rate to 90%)
- Reduce team burnout by identifying capacity issues early (Target: Keep team capacity utilization â‰¤ 85%)
- Enable data-driven sprint planning decisions (Target: 100% of sprints use balance analysis)
- Support continuous process improvement (Target: Monthly trend analysis of balance metrics)
- Help maintain sustainable team velocity (Target: Velocity variance within Â±10%)

## Priority and Scope

## Technical Notes

### API Endpoints

#### GET /api/sprints/{sprint_id}/balance
```python
@router.get("/sprints/{sprint_id}/balance", response_model=BalanceResponse)
async def get_sprint_balance(
    sprint_id: UUID,
    db: AsyncSession = Depends(get_db),
    current_user: User = Depends(get_current_user)
) -> BalanceResponse:
    """
    Get sprint balance analysis for the specified sprint.
    """
    return await balance_service.get_sprint_balance(sprint_id)
```

### Component Structure
```typescript
interface BalanceDashboardProps {
  sprintId: string;
  teamId: string;
  refreshInterval?: number;
}

export const BalanceDashboard: React.FC<BalanceDashboardProps> = ({
  sprintId,
  teamId,
  refreshInterval = 5000
}) => {
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);
  const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null);
  const [data, setData] = useState<BalanceData | null>(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    loadBalanceData();
  }, [sprintId, teamId]);

  // Implementation details...
};
```

## QA Strategy

### Test Scenarios

1. **Basic Flow**
   - View balance dashboard (verify all metrics visible)
   - Add/remove sprint items (verify real-time updates)
   - Adjust team capacity (verify recalculation)
   - View recommendations (verify relevance)
   - Apply changes (verify state updates)

2. **Edge Cases**

   - Full capacity (overflow indicators)
   - Skill mismatches (warning indicators)
   - Team member absence (capacity adjustment)
   - Holiday periods (calendar integration)
   - Partial day availability
