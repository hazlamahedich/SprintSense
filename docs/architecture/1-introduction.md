# 1. Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for SprintSense, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

## Starter Template or Existing Project
*   **Decision:** We will build this Greenfield project from scratch.
*   **Rationale:** Our chosen tech stack of FastAPI (Python) + a standard React SPA does not have a common, well-supported starter template. Building from scratch using standard tools (`vite`, standard FastAPI layout) gives us maximum control and avoids fighting against a template's opinions.
