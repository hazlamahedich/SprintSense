# Project Brief: SprintSense

## Executive Summary

SprintSense is an open-source, AI-powered agile project management platform designed to enhance team collaboration through intelligent automation while prioritizing human agency and data privacy. The primary problem it solves is the reactive nature of traditional project management tools by providing predictive insights and adaptive workflow optimization. The target market is development teams of 10-50 in tech companies. The key value proposition lies in its open-source, privacy-first design, transparent AI, and integration-friendly architecture.

## Problem Statement

Development teams currently rely on project management tools that are fundamentally reactive, focusing on tracking progress rather than providing intelligent, forward-looking insights. This leads to several pain points: sprint planning is a manual, time-consuming process with limited data to support decisions; valuable data from past sprints remains siloed and underutilized, preventing continuous improvement; and teams, especially in enterprise settings, are increasingly concerned about the privacy of their data on cloud-based platforms. Existing solutions like Jira, Trello, and Asana fall short as they lack predictive capabilities and do not offer the level of data control and privacy that many organizations now require. Solving this now is crucial for teams to remain competitive and efficient in a rapidly evolving market.

## Proposed Solution

The proposed solution is SprintSense, an open-source, AI-augmented agile project management platform. At its core, SprintSense will provide teams with predictive insights, adaptive workflow optimization, and collaborative intelligence to move beyond simple task tracking. Key differentiators include its open-source nature, a privacy-first architecture allowing for self-hosting, and transparent AI that provides explainable recommendations with human override capabilities. This solution will succeed by directly addressing the gaps left by current toolsâ€”offering proactive, intelligent features like a Smart Backlog, a Sprint Outcome Predictor, and a Collaborative Retrospective Engine. The high-level vision is to create a platform that amplifies human intelligence and collaboration, rather than replacing human decision-making.

  - **Historical Velocity Tracking:** The ability to track and analyze historical sprint velocity.
  - **Basic Retrospective Insights:** The first iteration of the AI-enhanced retrospective analysis.
  - **Self-Hosted Deployment:** A clear option for teams to self-host the platform.

### Out of Scope for MVP

  - Advanced predictive modeling and collaboration optimization features (Phase 2).
  - Privacy-first monitoring and a public API ecosystem (Phase 2).
  - Multi-team coordination, advanced analytics, and a mobile app (Phase 3).

### MVP Success Criteria

The MVP will be considered successful when we have 10 active pilot teams using the platform, we can demonstrate a 20% improvement in their sprint predictability, and we receive positive user feedback on the core features.

## Post-MVP Vision

### Phase 2 Features

  - Introduction of advanced predictive modeling for more accurate sprint forecasting.
  - Implementation of team collaboration optimization features, such as adaptive task assignment.
  - Rollout of the opt-in, privacy-first monitoring system.
  - Development of a public API to foster an ecosystem of integrations.
  - Launch of a community plugin framework to encourage third-party development.

### Long-term Vision

The long-term vision is to evolve SprintSense into a comprehensive, AI-augmented agile intelligence platform that not only supports individual teams but also provides insights and coordination across multiple teams. This includes an advanced analytics dashboard, a marketplace for machine learning models, and enterprise-grade deployment tools, all while staying true to the core principles of privacy and human-centric AI.

### Expansion Opportunities

  - A marketplace for community-developed plugins, creating a vibrant ecosystem around the platform.
  - Expansion beyond software development into other domains that can benefit from agile methodologies, such as marketing, design, and research.
  - Offering specialized, pre-trained AI models for specific industries or project types.

## Technical Considerations

### Platform Requirements

  - **Target Platforms:** The application will be web-based, accessible via modern web browsers.
  - **Performance Requirements:** The system must be highly available with low latency, particularly for API responses.

### Technology Preferences

  - **Frontend:** React with TypeScript.
  - **Backend:** FastAPI (Python) or Express.js (Node.js).
  - **Database:** A hybrid approach using PostgreSQL for structured data and MongoDB for documents and logs.
  - **Hosting/Infrastructure:** The application will be containerized using Docker and orchestrated with Kubernetes to ensure scalability and portability.

### Architecture Considerations
