## Dev Notes

### Data Models

- The `Invitation` model has attributes: `id` (UUID), `team_id` (FK to Team), `email` (string), `role` (enum: 'owner', 'member'), `status` (enum: 'pending', 'accepted', 'declined'), `inviter_id` (FK to User), `created_at` (Date)
- Invitations connect external email addresses to teams before user registration/acceptance
- The `role` field defines what permissions the user will have when they accept the invitation
- *[Source: docs/architecture/4-data-models.md]*

### API Specifications

- Team invitation will be handled via a `POST /api/v1/teams/{team_id}/invitations` endpoint
- List invitations via `GET /api/v1/teams/{team_id}/invitations` endpoint
- Authentication will continue using secure, HTTP-only cookies from Story 1.5
- **POST Request**: `{ "email": "string", "role": "member" | "owner" }`
- **POST Response (201)**: `{ "message": "Invitation sent successfully", "invitation": { "id": "uuid", "email": "string", "role": "string", "status": "pending", "created_at": "date" } }`
- **GET Response (200)**: `{ "invitations": [{ "id": "uuid", "email": "string", "role": "string", "status": "pending", "inviter_name": "string", "created_at": "date" }] }`
- **Error Responses**: 400 (validation), 403 (not team owner), 409 (already member), 429 (rate limit)
- *[Source: docs/architecture/5-api-specification.md]*

### Backend Architecture

- Invitation logic will be part of a new `InvitationService` module following established patterns
- A new `invitations.py` router will be created under `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/`
- The Repository Pattern will be used for all database interactions
- Dependency injection pattern will be followed for service layer
- Follow same authentication and authorization patterns established in Story 1.6
- *[Source: docs/architecture/10-backend-architecture.md, stories/1.6.team_creation.md]*

### Frontend Architecture

- A new `InviteUserModal.tsx` component will be created under `frontend/src/components/team/`
- A new `PendingInvitations.tsx` component will be created under `frontend/src/components/team/`
- Team invitation state will be managed by extending the existing Zustand store
- API calls will be handled in the dedicated service layer following established patterns
- Form validation will use React Hook Form with MUI components
- UI styling: Follow MUI theme customizations from coding standards (custom indigo/amber palette)
- Responsive design: Modal adapts to mobile and desktop layouts
- *[Source: docs/architecture/9-frontend-architecture.md, stories/1.6.team_creation.md]*

- Frontend Integration Tests: `frontend/src/__tests__/invitationIntegration.test.tsx`
- *[Source: docs/architecture/11-unified-project-structure.md]*

### Database

- PostgreSQL database with new `invitations` table
- UUID primary keys following established patterns
- Foreign key relationships between invitations, teams, and users (inviter)
- Database migrations managed via Alembic (established in Story 1.2)
- *[Source: docs/architecture/3-tech-stack.md, docs/architecture/4-data-models.md]*

### Security

- Invitation creation requires authentication and team ownership authorization
- Input validation for email addresses (required, valid email format, sanitization)
- Rate limiting: 20 invitations per team owner per hour (prevent spam/abuse)
- Authorization: only team owners can send invitations for their teams
- Email validation prevents script injection and validates proper email format
- SQL injection prevention via parameterized queries (Repository Pattern)
- *[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#security-best-practices]*

### Testing Requirements

- Backend: Pytest unit tests for `InvitationService` and integration tests for `/api/v1/teams/{team_id}/invitations` endpoints
- Frontend: Vitest/React Testing Library tests for `InviteUserModal` and `PendingInvitations` components, mocking API calls
- Test coverage: 80% for backend, 70% for frontend
- Test email validation, duplicate prevention, authorization checks, error handling
- Test data setup: Create test team and users via existing auth fixtures from Story 1.5
- Integration tests use test database with applied migrations
- Mock authentication context and team ownership for frontend tests
- *[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#testing-requirements]*

### Previous Story Context

- Story 1.6 established team creation and team ownership patterns
- Authentication middleware and user session management patterns are established and should be reused
- Team ownership validation patterns from Story 1.6 should be extended for invitation authorization
- Database schema includes teams and team_members tables with proper relationships
- *[Source: stories/1.6.team_creation.md]*

### Local Supabase Usage Rules

- Use local Supabase instance for database management
- Supabase CLI and Supabase MCP are available for managing database operations
- Follow established migration patterns using Alembic (not Supabase migrations)
- Continue using existing FastAPI + PostgreSQL patterns rather than Supabase Auth or RPC
- *[Source: User Rules - Local Supabase Preference]*
