# Story 1.1: Project Initialization

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** Developer,
**I want** a new project repository with a basic, well-defined CI/CD pipeline and testing framework,
**so that** we can establish a solid foundation for automated testing and deployment.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Monorepo created.
2. A basic `README.md` file is created.
3. CI/CD runs linter and unit tests.
4. Manual trigger deploys to dev.
5. `/health` endpoint returns `200 OK`.
6. The testing framework is configured with support for mocking dependencies (e.g., using `unittest.mock`).

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] **Task 1: Initialize Monorepo (AC: #1)**
    - [ ] Create a new git repository.
    - [ ] Set up a monorepo structure (e.g., using Lerna/Nx for JS, or just directories for a simple project).
- [ ] **Task 2: Create `README.md` (AC: #2)**
    - [ ] Create a basic `README.md` file with a project title and brief description.
- [ ] **Task 3: Configure CI/CD Pipeline (AC: #3, #4)**
    - [ ] Set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.
    - [ ] Configure the pipeline to run on every push to `main`.
    - [ ] Add a linting step.
    - [ ] Add a unit test step.
    - [ ] Add a manual deployment step for the `dev` environment.
- [ ] **Task 4: Create Health Check Endpoint (AC: #5)**
    - [ ] Create a simple web server (e.g., using FastAPI).
    - [ ] Add a `/health` endpoint that returns a `200 OK` response.
- [ ] **Task 5: Configure Testing Framework (AC: #6)**
    - [ ] Choose and configure a testing framework (e.g., `pytest` for Python).
    - [ ] Ensure the framework supports mocking dependencies.

## Dev Notes
This story is foundational. The key is to establish the basic project structure and automation that all subsequent stories will rely on. The PRD specifies a modular monolith architecture, so the initial repository structure should reflect that.

### Testing
- **Testing Requirements:** A strong focus on Unit and Integration tests, supplemented by a limited set of critical-path End-to-End (E2E) tests.
- **Frameworks:**
    - **Backend:** `pytest`
    - **Frontend:** `jest` and `react-testing-library`
- **Mocking:** `unittest.mock` for the backend.
