# Story 1.1: Project Initialization

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** Developer,
**I want** a new project repository with a basic, well-defined CI/CD pipeline and testing framework,
**so that** we can establish a solid foundation for automated testing and deployment.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Monorepo created.
2. A basic `README.md` file is created.
3. CI/CD runs linter and unit tests.
4. Manual trigger deploys to dev.
5. `/health` endpoint returns `200 OK`.
6. The testing framework is configured with support for mocking dependencies (e.g., using `unittest.mock`).

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Task 1: Initialize Monorepo (AC: #1)**
  - [x] Create a new git repository. *(Evidence: `.git/` directory present)*
  - [x] Set up a monorepo structure (e.g., using Lerna/Nx for JS, or just directories for a simple project). *(Evidence: `frontend/`, `backend/`, `ops/`, `docs/` directories)*
- [x] **Task 2: Create `README.md` (AC: #2)**
  - [x] Create a basic `README.md` file with a project title and brief description. *(Evidence: `README.md` with comprehensive project info)*
- [x] **Task 3: Configure CI/CD Pipeline (AC: #3, #4)**
  - [x] Set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions. *(Evidence: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and `.github/workflows/deploy-dev.yml`)*
  - [x] Configure the pipeline to run on every push to `main`. *(Evidence: CI triggers on push to main/develop branches)*
  - [x] Add a linting step. *(Evidence: Black, isort, flake8, mypy, ESLint, Prettier configured)*
  - [x] Add a unit test step. *(Evidence: pytest and vitest test steps in CI)*
  - [x] Add a manual deployment step for the `dev` environment. *(Evidence: Manual workflow_dispatch trigger in deploy-dev.yml)*
- [x] **Task 4: Create Health Check Endpoint (AC: #5)**
  - [x] Create a simple web server (e.g., using FastAPI). *(Evidence: FastAPI app in `backend/app/main.py`)*
  - [x] Add a `/health` endpoint that returns a `200 OK` response. *(Evidence: `backend/app/api/routers/health.py` returns `{"status": "OK"}`)*
- [x] **Task 5: Configure Testing Framework (AC: #6)**
  - [x] Choose and configure a testing framework (e.g., `pytest` for Python). *(Evidence: pytest configured in `pyproject.toml`, vitest in `package.json`)*
  - [x] Ensure the framework supports mocking dependencies. *(Evidence: `unittest.mock` support, test fixtures in `conftest.py`)*

## Dev Notes

This story is foundational. The key is to establish the basic project structure and automation that all subsequent stories will rely on. The PRD specifies a modular monolith architecture, so the initial repository structure should reflect that.

### Testing

- **Testing Requirements:** A strong focus on Unit and Integration tests, supplemented by a limited set of critical-path End-to-End (E2E) tests.
- **Frameworks:**
  - **Backend:** `pytest`
  - **Frontend:** `jest` and `react-testing-library`
- **Mocking:** `unittest.mock` for the backend.

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used

James ðŸ’» (BMAD Dev Agent) - claude-4-sonnet via Warp Terminal

### Debug Log References

- Test execution: `cd backend && poetry run pytest tests/ -v` â†’ 3 passed, 10 warnings
- OpenTelemetry warnings expected (no collector running in test environment)

### Completion Notes List

- **2025-09-15**: Comprehensive verification of all acceptance criteria
- **Health endpoint verified**: `/health` returns `{"status": "OK", "service": "SprintSense Backend"}` with 200 status
- **CI/CD pipelines confirmed**: Both `ci.yml` (automated) and `deploy-dev.yml` (manual) workflows functional
- **Testing frameworks operational**: pytest (backend) with mocking, vitest (frontend) configured
- **Monorepo structure validated**: All required directories (`frontend/`, `backend/`, `ops/`, `docs/`) present
- **Documentation complete**: Comprehensive README.md with setup instructions
