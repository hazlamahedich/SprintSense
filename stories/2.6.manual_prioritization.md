# Story 2.6: Manual Prioritization

## Status
✅ **APPROVED**

## Story
**As a** team member,
**I want** to manually and accessibly change the priority of work items,
**so that** I can organize the backlog.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Uses accessible "Move to Top/Up/Down/Bottom" buttons with clear visual indicators
2. Provides immediate visual feedback during priority operations (loading states, success/error messages)
3. Saves priority changes persistently to database with proper error handling
4. View updates for all team members within 3 seconds of change
5. Handles edge cases gracefully (e.g., moving top item up shows appropriate message)
6. Prevents conflicting priority changes with clear user messaging when conflicts occur

## Dev Notes

### Testing
**Requirements from Architecture:**
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#testing-requirements]
- **Backend**: 80% test coverage with pytest-cov
- **Frontend**: 70% test coverage with vitest  
- **Test file naming**: `test_*.py` (backend), `*.test.tsx` (frontend)
- **Testing location**: `src/__tests__/` (frontend), `tests/` (backend)

**Testing frameworks to use:**
- Frontend: Vitest, React Testing Library
- Backend: pytest, httpx AsyncClient for API tests
- Mock dependencies using `unittest.mock` (backend) or `vi` (frontend)

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 2.5 (Soft-Delete Work Item):
- Work item PATCH endpoint patterns are established and can be reused
- Material-UI theme with custom colors and animations is working well
- Team membership authorization pattern is proven and tested
- WorkItem data model and API patterns are fully implemented
- Optimistic UI update patterns with rollback are implemented
- Error handling and user feedback patterns are established

### Data Models
[Source: docs/architecture/4-data-models.md#workitem-revised]

**WorkItem Schema - Relevant Fields for Priority:**
- `id` (UUID): Primary key, immutable after creation
- `teamId` (FK): Links to Team entity, required for authorization (immutable)
- `priority` (float): Numeric priority value for ordering (will be updated)
- `updated_at` (Date): Auto-updated when priority changes
- All other fields remain unchanged during priority updates

**Key Implementation Notes:**
- The `priority` field is a float to allow for flexible reordering
- Priority updates should recalculate other item priorities to maintain proper ordering
- Use transaction handling to ensure atomic priority updates
- Consider using priority gaps (e.g., 1000, 2000, 3000) to minimize cascading updates

### API Specifications  
[Source: docs/architecture/5-api-specification.md#example-endpoints-work-items]

**New Endpoint:** `PATCH /teams/{teamId}/work-items/{workItemId}/priority`
- **Authentication**: Secure HTTP-only cookies (reuse existing pattern)
- **Authorization**: User must be team member (reuse existing pattern from Story 2.5)
- **Request Body**: `{"action": "move_to_top" | "move_up" | "move_down" | "move_to_bottom" | "set_position", "position"?: number}`
- **Response**: 200 OK with updated WorkItem schema (priority updated)
- **Content-Type**: application/json

**Response Schema:**
```python
# Returns standard WorkItem schema with updated priority
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "teamId": "uuid", 
  "priority": 1500.0,  # New priority value
  "title": "string",
  "updated_at": "2025-09-19T10:17:45Z",
  # ... other WorkItem fields
}
```

**Conflict Resolution:**
- **409 Conflict**: When concurrent priority changes occur, return conflict details
- **Conflict Response**: Include current state and suggested resolution
- **Retry Logic**: Client should fetch latest state and allow user to retry

### Component Specifications
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md, docs/architecture/3-tech-stack.md]

**Technology Stack:**
- React with function components only (no class components)
- Material-UI (MUI) for base components with custom theme
- TypeScript with strict null checks
- Zustand for global state management if needed

**Component Structure:**
```
frontend/src/
├── components/feature/backlog/
│   ├── PriorityControls.tsx         # Priority control buttons component
│   ├── PriorityButton.tsx           # Individual priority action button
│   └── [existing components...]     # BacklogItem, etc.
├── hooks/
│   ├── usePriorityUpdate.ts         # Priority update hook
│   └── [existing hooks...]          # useEditWorkItem, etc.
├── services/
│   └── workItemService.ts           # Extend with updateWorkItemPriority method
└── types/
    └── workItem.types.ts            # Extend with priority action types
```

**Required Components:**
1. `PriorityControls` - Container for priority action buttons
2. `PriorityButton` - Individual action button (move up, down, etc.)
3. Custom hook `usePriorityUpdate` - Handle priority API calls and state management
4. Extended `workItemService` - Add updateWorkItemPriority method

### File Locations

- `app/services/work_item_service.py` - Add priority update methods
- `app/models/work_item.py` - Priority field already exists, no changes needed
- `app/schemas/work_item.py` - Add priority action request/response schemas

**Test Files:**
- `apps/web/src/__tests__/PriorityControls.test.tsx`
- `apps/web/src/__tests__/PriorityButton.test.tsx`  
- `apps/web/src/__tests__/usePriorityUpdate.test.tsx`
- `apps/api/tests/test_work_items_priority.py`

### Technical Constraints
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]

**Priority Update Implementation:**
- Use float values for priority to allow flexible reordering
- Implement atomic transactions for priority updates
- Consider priority gaps (1000, 2000, 3000) to minimize cascading updates
- Handle edge cases like moving first/last items
- Maintain referential integrity during priority changes

**Accessibility Requirements:**
- All priority controls must be keyboard accessible
- Proper ARIA labels for screen readers ("Move work item up in priority")
- Focus management after priority changes
- Clear audio feedback for screen reader users
- Support standard keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Up/Down for priority)

**Performance Requirements:**
- Priority controls should render within 200ms
- Priority update API response time should be under 500ms
- UI updates should propagate immediately to all team members
- Optimistic updates should provide immediate feedback
- Rollback mechanism for failed priority updates

**User Experience Requirements:**
- Clear visual feedback during priority operations (loading states)
- Success notification confirms operation completion  
- Error messages provide clear guidance for resolution
- Consistent button styling with existing MUI theme
- Intuitive button placement and grouping
- Edge case handling with appropriate user messaging (e.g., "Item is already at top")
- Conflict resolution dialogs when concurrent changes occur
- Real-time updates visible within 3 seconds across all team members

**Security Considerations:**
- Validate user authorization for both team membership and work item access
- Sanitize all input data to prevent XSS attacks
- Rate limiting on priority endpoints to prevent abuse
- Log all priority operations for audit trail

### Supabase Development Notes
[Source: User Rules - 89So90gDNXHlLoATczmZRE]
- Use local Supabase instance for development
- Leverage Supabase CLI for database management
- Ensure priority update operations work with local Supabase setup
- Test real-time functionality with Supabase WebSocket connections
