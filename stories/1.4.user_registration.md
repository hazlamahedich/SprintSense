story_statement: "As a new user, I want to securely register for an account, so that I can trust the system with my information."

acceptance_criteria:
  - "A new database migration is created for the `users` table."
  - "A registration page exists at the '/register' route with fields for full name, email, and password."
  - "The system handles registration attempts with an email address that already exists."
  - "User passwords are not stored in plaintext; they are securely hashed using `bcrypt`."
  - "Upon successful registration, a new user record is created in the database."
  - "The user is automatically logged in and redirected to the main dashboard after registration."

dev_notes:
  - section: "Data Models"
    notes:
      - "The `users` table will be created based on the `User` model."
      - "Model definition is in `docs/architecture/4-data-models.md`."
      - "Fields: `id`, `email`, `hashed_password`, `full_name`, `is_active`, `created_at`, `updated_at`."
      - "The `hashed_password` field should store the result of the `bcrypt` hashing algorithm."
      - "[Source: docs/architecture/4-data-models.md#user-revised]"

  - section: "API Specifications"
    notes:
      - "A new endpoint `POST /api/v1/users/register` should be created."
      - "Request Body (Pydantic Schema `UserCreateRequest`): `full_name: str`, `email: str`, `password: str`."
      - "Success Response (201 Created): `UserResponse` schema containing user details (excluding password)."
      - "Error Response (409 Conflict): If email already exists."
      - "The endpoint should use dependency injection for the `UserService`."
      - "[Source: docs/architecture/10-backend-architecture.md, docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]"

  - section: "Backend Architecture"
    notes:
      - "Create a new `UserService` in `backend/app/domains/services/user_service.py`."
      - "The service should contain a `create_user` method that handles the business logic for registration."
      - "Password hashing logic should be in `backend/app/core/security.py`."
      - "Use SQLAlchemy 2.0 async patterns for database interaction."
      - "[Source: docs/architecture/10-backend-architecture.md]"

  - section: "Frontend Architecture"
    notes:
      - "Create a new registration page component at `frontend/src/pages/RegisterPage.tsx`."
      - "Use `React Hook Form` for form management and validation."
      - "Use `TanStack Query` for the mutation to the registration endpoint."
      - "On success, the user should be redirected to the dashboard."
      - "Global user state should be managed by a Zustand store."
      - "[Source: docs/architecture/9-frontend-architecture.md]"

  - section: "File Locations"
    notes:
      - "Database Migration: `backend/migrations/versions/`"
      - "User Model: `backend/app/domains/models/user.py`"
      - "User Schema: `backend/app/domains/schemas/user.py`"
      - "User Service: `backend/app/domains/services/user_service.py`"

      - "Registration Page: `frontend/src/pages/RegisterPage.tsx`"
      - "[Source: docs/architecture/11-unified-project-structure.md]"

  - section: "Security"
    notes:
      - "User passwords must be securely hashed using `bcrypt` before being stored in the database, as specified in the backend implementation task."
      - "The system must prevent timing attacks by ensuring response times are similar for existing and non-existing user emails during registration attempts."
      - "[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#security-best-practices]"

  - section: "Testing Requirements"
    notes:
      - "Backend: Pytest unit tests for the `UserService` and an integration test for the registration endpoint."
      - "Frontend: Vitest/React Testing Library tests for the `RegisterPage` component, mocking the API call."
      - "Minimum test coverage: 80% for backend, 70% for frontend."
      - "[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#testing-requirements]"
