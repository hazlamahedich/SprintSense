# Story 2.1: Create Work Item Schema

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** Developer,
**I want** to create the database schema for work items,
**so that** we can store backlog data.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A new database migration is created for the `work_items` table.
2. The schema is applied to the database.

## Tasks / Subtasks
**IMPORTANT**: Tasks must be executed in sequence due to dependencies: 1→2→3→4→5

- [ ] **1. Create Database Migration for Work Items Table (AC: #1)**
    - [ ] Create Alembic migration file using `alembic revision --autogenerate -m "add work_items table"`
    - [ ] Create migration for `work_items` table with `id` (UUID), `team_id` (FK), `sprint_id` (FK, nullable), `author_id` (FK), `assignee_id` (FK, nullable), `type` (enum: 'story', 'bug', 'task'), `title` (string), `description` (string, nullable), `status` (enum: 'backlog', 'todo', 'in_progress', 'done', 'archived'), `priority` (float), `story_points` (integer, nullable), `completed_at` (Date, nullable), `created_at` (Date), `updated_at` (Date), `source_sprint_id_for_action_item` (FK, nullable)
    - [ ] Add proper foreign key constraints to teams and users tables
    - [ ] Leave Sprint FK constraints for future implementation (Sprint model will be created in Epic 4)
    - [ ] Add database indexes on frequently queried columns (team_id, status, priority)
    - [ ] Apply migration to development database using `alembic upgrade head`
- [ ] **2. Create SQLAlchemy ORM Model (AC: #1)** [Depends on: Task 1]
    - [ ] Create `WorkItem` model in `backend/app/domains/models/work_item.py`
    - [ ] Define relationships to Team, User (author), User (assignee), Sprint models
    - [ ] Implement proper enum classes for `type` and `status` fields
    - [ ] Add model validation using Pydantic validators where appropriate
    - [ ] Export model in `backend/app/domains/models/__init__.py`
- [ ] **3. Create Pydantic Schemas (AC: #1)** [Depends on: Task 2]
    - [ ] Create request/response schemas in `backend/app/domains/schemas/work_item.py`
    - [ ] Implement `WorkItemCreateRequest`, `WorkItemUpdateRequest`, `WorkItemResponse` schemas
    - [ ] Add proper field validation and type hints following coding standards
    - [ ] Export schemas in `backend/app/domains/schemas/__init__.py`
- [ ] **4. Update Database Schema Documentation (AC: #2)** [Depends on: Task 1]
    - [ ] Update `docs/architecture/8-database-schema.md` with work_items table definition
    - [ ] Document relationships and foreign key constraints
    - [ ] Add indexing strategy documentation
    - [ ] Update entity relationship diagrams if present
- [ ] **5. Create Unit Tests for Models and Schemas (AC: #2)** [Depends on: Tasks 2, 3]
    - [ ] Write unit tests for WorkItem model in `backend/tests/unit/test_work_item_model.py`
    - [ ] Write unit tests for WorkItem schemas in `backend/tests/unit/test_work_item_schemas.py`
    - [ ] Test model relationships and constraints
    - [ ] Test schema validation rules and edge cases
    - [ ] Achieve minimum 80% test coverage for new code

## Dev Notes

### Data Models
- The `WorkItem` model represents a single, atomic unit of work in the backlog (user story, bug, or task)
- **Key Attributes from architecture**: `id` (UUID), `teamId` (FK), `sprintId` (FK, nullable), `authorId` (FK), `assigneeId` (FK, nullable), `type` (enum: 'story', 'bug', 'task'), `title` (string), `description` (string, nullable), `status` (enum: 'backlog', 'todo', 'in_progress', 'done', 'archived'), `priority` (float), `storyPoints` (integer, nullable), `completedAt` (Date, nullable), `created_at` (Date), `updated_at` (Date), `sourceSprintIdForActionItem` (FK, nullable)
- **Sprint Dependencies**: Sprint model is defined in architecture but will be implemented in Epic 4. Sprint-related fields (sprintId, sourceSprintIdForActionItem) are nullable to allow work items to exist in backlog before sprints are created
- **Field Explanations**: `sourceSprintIdForActionItem` tracks which sprint generated this work item as an action item during retrospectives
- Foreign key relationships: Team (1:Many), User as author (1:Many), User as assignee (1:Many), Sprint (1:Many, future implementation)
- *[Source: docs/architecture/4-data-models.md]*

### Database Architecture
- PostgreSQL database with UUID primary keys following established patterns
- Foreign key relationships between work_items, teams, users, and sprints tables
- Database migrations managed via Alembic (established in Story 1.2)
- Proper indexing required on team_id, status, and priority columns for performance
- *[Source: docs/architecture/8-database-schema.md, docs/architecture/10-backend-architecture.md]*

### Backend Architecture
- WorkItem model will follow the Repository Pattern established in previous stories
- Use SQLAlchemy ORM with proper async patterns from existing codebase
- Dependency injection pattern will be followed for service layer (future stories)
- Follow same database connection patterns established in Story 1.4-1.7
- *[Source: docs/architecture/10-backend-architecture.md, stories/1.7.invite_users_to_team.md]*

### File Locations
- WorkItem Model: `backend/app/domains/models/work_item.py`
- WorkItem Schemas: `backend/app/domains/schemas/work_item.py`
- Database Migration: `backend/alembic/versions/{timestamp}_add_work_items_table.py`
- Database Schema Documentation: `docs/architecture/8-database-schema.md`

- Unit Tests (Schemas): `backend/tests/unit/test_work_item_schemas.py`
- *[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md, existing project structure]*

### Local Supabase Usage Rules
- Use local Supabase instance for database management
- Supabase CLI and Supabase MCP are available for managing database operations
- Follow established migration patterns using Alembic (not Supabase migrations)
- Continue using existing FastAPI + PostgreSQL patterns rather than Supabase Auth or RPC
- *[Source: User Rules - Local Supabase Preference]*

### Database Naming Conventions
- All database tables use snake_case naming (work_items)
- All database columns use snake_case naming (team_id, created_at)
- Backend Python code uses snake_case for variables and functions
- Primary keys are UUIDs following established patterns
- *[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]*

### Security Considerations
- UUID primary keys provide non-enumerable IDs for security
- Foreign key constraints ensure data integrity
- SQL injection prevention via parameterized queries (SQLAlchemy ORM)
- Input validation through Pydantic schemas with proper field constraints
- *[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#security-best-practices]*

### Performance Considerations
- Database indexes on team_id for team-based queries
- Index on status column for filtering by work item status
- Index on priority column for ordering and filtering
- Nullable sprint_id allows work items to exist in backlog without sprint assignment
- *[Source: docs/architecture/4-data-models.md, docs/architecture/8-database-schema.md]*

### Previous Story Context
- Database connection patterns established in Stories 1.4-1.7
- UUID primary key patterns established in User, Team, TeamMember, and Invitation models
- Alembic migration patterns established in Story 1.2
- SQLAlchemy ORM and Pydantic schema patterns established in Stories 1.4-1.7
- *[Source: stories/1.2.setup_database_migrations.md, stories/1.4.user_registration.md, stories/1.7.invite_users_to_team.md]*
