# Story 1.3: Setup API Type Generation

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** Developer,
**I want** an automated way to generate TypeScript types from our backend API specification,
**so that** we can ensure type safety between the frontend and backend.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A code generation tool (`openapi-typescript-codegen`) is added as a development dependency.
2. An `npm` script is created to run the generator against the auto-generated OpenAPI spec from the FastAPI backend.
3. The generated types are output to the `packages/shared-types` directory.
4. The CI pipeline is updated to include a type-checking step.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] **Task 1: Add Code Generation Dependency (AC: #1)**
    - [x] Add `openapi-typescript-codegen` to the `package.json` file in the `frontend` package as a dev dependency. *(Evidence: `"openapi-typescript-codegen": "^0.29.0"` in frontend/package.json)*
- [x] **Task 2: Create NPM Script (AC: #2)**
    - [x] Add a new script to the `frontend/package.json` file (e.g., `"gen-types"`) that runs `openapi-typescript-codegen`. *(Evidence: `"gen-types"` script in frontend/package.json)*
    - [x] The script should point to the backend's OpenAPI spec URL (e.g., `http://localhost:8000/openapi.json`). *(Evidence: Script points to `http://localhost:8000/api/v1/openapi.json`)*
- [x] **Task 3: Configure Output Directory (AC: #3)**
    - [x] Configure the `openapi-typescript-codegen` command to output the generated types to the `packages/shared-types` directory. *(Evidence: `--output ../packages/shared-types` in gen-types script, package.json and README.md created)*
- [x] **Task 4: Update CI Pipeline (AC: #4)**
    - [x] Add a new step to the CI pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) that runs the type generation script. *(Evidence: New `type-generation` job with backend startup and `npm run gen-types`)*
    - [x] Add a type-checking step to the CI pipeline that uses the generated types. *(Evidence: TypeScript compilation check in CI pipeline)*

## Dev Notes
This story is crucial for maintaining type safety between the frontend and backend. The `openapi.json` file is automatically generated by FastAPI. The frontend should use the generated types for all API calls.

### Testing
- No specific tests are required for this story, as it is about tooling and automation. The successful execution of the type generation and type-checking steps in the CI pipeline will validate this story.

## Dev Agent Record
### Agent Model Used
James ðŸ’» (BMAD Dev Agent) - claude-4-sonnet via Warp Terminal

### Debug Log References
- Package installation: `npm install --save-dev openapi-typescript-codegen` âœ… Successful (v0.29.0)
- FastAPI configuration test: OpenAPI URL `http://localhost:8000/api/v1/openapi.json` verified
- CI pipeline validation: New `type-generation` job added with full backend startup

- `frontend/package.json` - Added openapi-typescript-codegen dependency and gen-types script
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Added type-generation job with comprehensive testing
- `.gitignore` - Added generated types directories to ignore list

**Created Files:**
- `packages/shared-types/package.json` - Package configuration for shared types
- `packages/shared-types/README.md` - Documentation for type generation process

**Verified Implementation Files:**
- `backend/app/main.py` - FastAPI OpenAPI configuration confirmed

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-16

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment
The API type generation implementation is comprehensive and follows best practices. All acceptance criteria have been met successfully.

### QA Validation Performed
- Backend tests: âœ… All tests passing (3 passed, 10 warnings acceptable)
- OpenAPI endpoint: âœ… Serving correctly at `/api/v1/openapi.json`
- Type generation: âœ… Successfully generates types to `packages/shared-types/`
- Frontend build: âœ… TypeScript compilation successful after fixes
- Frontend linting: âœ… ESLint passes with no errors

### Issues Found and Resolved
1. **Database URL Format**: Fixed `postgresql+psycopg_async` to `postgresql+psycopg` for Alembic compatibility
2. **NPM Script**: Fixed `gen-types` script to use `npx openapi-typescript-codegen`
3. **TypeScript Errors**: Fixed error handling in HealthPage.tsx and removed unused React import

### Compliance Check
- Coding Standards: [âœ“]
- Project Structure: [âœ“]
- Testing Strategy: [âœ“] - Type generation validated
- All ACs Met: [âœ“]

### Security Review
[âœ“] Type generation process is secure, no sensitive data exposed in generated types.

### Performance Considerations
Type generation is performed at build time, no runtime performance impact.

### Gate Status
Gate: PASS â†’ docs/qa/gates/1.3-setup-api-type-generation.yml

### Recommended Status
[âœ“ Ready for Done]
