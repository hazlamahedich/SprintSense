story_statement: "As a Developer, I want an automated way to generate TypeScript types from our backend API specification, so that we can ensure type safety between the frontend and backend."

acceptance_criteria:
  - "A code generation tool (`openapi-typescript-codegen`) is added as a development dependency."
  - "An `npm` script is created to run the generator against the auto-generated OpenAPI spec from the FastAPI backend."
  - "The generated types are output to the `packages/shared-types` directory."
  - "The CI pipeline is updated to include a type-checking step."

dev_notes:
  - section: "General"
    notes:
      - "This story is crucial for maintaining type safety between the frontend and backend."
      - "The `openapi.json` file is automatically generated by FastAPI."
      - "The frontend should use the generated types for all API calls."
  - section: "Testing"
    notes:
      - "No specific tests are required for this story, as it is about tooling and automation."
      - "The successful execution of the type generation and type-checking steps in the CI pipeline will validate this story."

tasks:
  - task: "1. Add Code Generation Dependency (AC: #1)"
    sub_tasks:
      - "Add `openapi-typescript-codegen` to the `package.json` file in the `frontend` package as a dev dependency. (Evidence: `\"openapi-typescript-codegen\": \"^0.29.0\"` in frontend/package.json)"
    ac_ref: [1]
    status: "Done"
  - task: "2. Create NPM Script (AC: #2)"
    sub_tasks:
      - "Add a new script to the `frontend/package.json` file (e.g., `\"gen-types\"`) that runs `openapi-typescript-codegen`. (Evidence: `\"gen-types\"` script in frontend/package.json)"
      - "The script should point to the backend's OpenAPI spec URL (e.g., `http://localhost:8000/openapi.json`). (Evidence: Script points to `http://localhost:8000/api/v1/openapi.json`)"
    ac_ref: [2]
    status: "Done"
  - task: "3. Configure Output Directory (AC: #3)"
    sub_tasks:
      - "Configure the `openapi-typescript-codegen` command to output the generated types to the `packages/shared-types` directory. (Evidence: `--output ../packages/shared-types` in gen-types script, package.json and README.md created)"
    ac_ref: [3]
    status: "Done"
  - task: "4. Update CI Pipeline (AC: #4)"
    sub_tasks:
      - "Add a new step to the CI pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) that runs the type generation script. (Evidence: New `type-generation` job with backend startup and `npm run gen-types`)"
      - "Add a type-checking step to the CI pipeline that uses the generated types. (Evidence: TypeScript compilation check in CI pipeline)"
