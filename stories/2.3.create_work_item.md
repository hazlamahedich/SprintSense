# Story 2.3: Create Work Item

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** team member,
**I want** to create a new work item,
**so that** I can add new tasks and ideas to our team's backlog.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. "Create" button exists on the backlog page and is prominently displayed with clear CTA styling
2. Form has title (required, max 200 chars) and description (optional, max 2000 chars) fields with proper validation and error messages
3. Work item type selection (story, bug, task) is required with 'story' as default, includes visual type indicators
4. New item added to top of backlog with default status 'backlog', auto-assigned highest priority for top placement
5. Created work item must capture the author as current logged-in user, with proper attribution display
6. Form provides clear success notification and error handling with specific user-friendly messages
7. View refreshes to show new item immediately after successful creation (real-time updates are future enhancement)
8. Form validation prevents submission with empty title or exceeds character limits with inline feedback

- `authorId` (FK): User who created the work item (current logged-in user)
- `assigneeId` (FK, nullable): Should be null for new items
- `type` (enum): 'story', 'bug', 'task' - user selectable
- `title` (string): Display title, required, max 200 characters
- `description` (string, nullable): Detailed description, optional, max 2000 characters
- `status` (enum): Should default to 'backlog' for new items
- `priority` (float): Auto-calculate as highest priority + 1 for top placement
- `storyPoints` (integer, nullable): Should be null for new items
- `completedAt` (Date, nullable): Should be null for new items
- `created_at` (Date): Auto-generated timestamp
- `updated_at` (Date): Auto-generated timestamp
- `sourceSprintIdForActionItem` (FK, nullable): Should be null for manually created items

### API Specifications
[Source: docs/architecture/5-api-specification.md#example-endpoints-work-items]

**Endpoint:** `POST /teams/{teamId}/work-items`
- **Authentication**: Secure HTTP-only cookies (already implemented)
- **Authorization**: User must be team member (reuse existing pattern)
- **Request Body**: CreateWorkItemRequest schema
- **Response**: 201 Created with WorkItem schema
- **Content-Type**: application/json

**Request Schema (CreateWorkItemRequest):**
```python
class CreateWorkItemRequest(BaseModel):
    title: str = Field(..., min_length=1, max_length=200)
    description: Optional[str] = Field(None, max_length=2000)
    type: WorkItemType = Field(default=WorkItemType.story)
    # teamId comes from URL path parameter
    # All other fields auto-generated or defaulted
```

### Supabase Integration Notes
[Source: User rules - Local Supabase usage preference]
- Use local Supabase instance for development
- Leverage Supabase CLI for database schema management
- Consider using Supabase realtime features for live updates (future enhancement)
- Database migrations should be managed through existing Alembic setup

### Poetry Integration
[Source: User rules - Poetry for Python dependencies]
- Use `poetry run` prefix for all Python commands during development
- Add any new Python dependencies through `poetry add`

### QA Review - January 17, 2025
**Reviewed By:** Quinn (Test Architect) - **COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS**

### 🎯 **OVERALL ASSESSMENT: ⚠️ CONCERNS - Requires Clarification Before Implementation**

#### **✅ STRENGTHS IDENTIFIED**

**Requirements Traceability**: EXCELLENT
- All 8 acceptance criteria are testable and traceable to specific test scenarios
- Clear mapping between ACs and implementation tasks
- Comprehensive test coverage planned (Unit, Integration, E2E)

**Technical Architecture**: STRONG
- Well-defined component structure and separation of concerns
- Proper TypeScript integration with strict null checks
- Clear API specification with Pydantic validation

- Coverage requirements specified (80% backend, 70% frontend)
- Proper test file organization and naming conventions

#### **⚠️ QUALITY CONCERNS REQUIRING RESOLUTION**

**CONCERN 1: Priority Calculation Race Condition Risk**
- **Issue**: "Highest priority + 1" algorithm could cause conflicts with concurrent users
- **Impact**: Data integrity issues, incorrect backlog ordering
- **Required Fix**: Need atomic database transaction handling and collision detection
- **Test Requirement**: Add concurrent creation testing scenarios

**CONCERN 2: Error Handling Specifications Insufficient**
- **Issue**: "Graceful error handling" too vague for consistent implementation
- **Impact**: Inconsistent user experience, difficult debugging
- **Required Fix**: Define specific error codes, messages, and recovery behaviors for:
  - Network timeouts
  - Validation failures
  - Authorization errors
  - Duplicate submissions
- **Test Requirement**: Add specific error condition testing matrix

**CONCERN 3: Performance Validation Strategy Missing**
- **Issue**: "<1 second average" requirement lacks validation approach
- **Impact**: No way to verify performance requirements are met
- **Required Fix**: Define performance testing strategy including:
  - Baseline measurement approach
  - Load testing for form submission
  - UI responsiveness metrics
- **Test Requirement**: Add performance benchmarking to test suite

#### **📋 RECOMMENDED ACTIONS BEFORE DEVELOPMENT**

1. **Priority Calculation Enhancement**
   - Define atomic priority assignment algorithm with database-level constraints
   - Add collision detection and retry logic
   - Document expected behavior for concurrent scenarios

2. **Error Handling Specification**
   - Create error code taxonomy for create work item operations
   - Define user-facing error messages for each scenario
   - Specify recovery actions for each error type

3. **Performance Testing Framework**
   - Add performance test cases to test plan
   - Define performance measurement tools and thresholds
   - Create monitoring strategy for production validation

#### **🎯 QUALITY GATE DECISION**

**Status**: ⚠️ **CONCERNS** - Development may proceed with risk mitigation
**Risk Level**: MEDIUM - Manageable with proper attention to identified concerns
**Quality Score**: 78/100 (Good foundation, needs clarification on critical areas)

#### **🚦 GATE CRITERIA FOR APPROVAL**

To achieve PASS status, the following must be addressed:
- [ ] Priority calculation algorithm specified with concurrency handling
- [ ] Error handling matrix completed with specific error codes and messages
- [ ] Performance testing strategy documented with measurement approach

**Alternative Path**: Development team may proceed with current specification while addressing concerns during implementation, provided they commit to resolving identified risks before story completion.

### **📈 NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS ASSESSMENT**

#### **Security**: ✅ SATISFACTORY
- Team membership authorization properly specified
- Input validation through Pydantic schemas
- XSS and SQL injection prevention measures defined

#### **Performance**: 🟡 CONCERNS
- Response time target specified (<1s) but validation strategy missing
- UI performance considerations for large backlogs noted but not detailed

#### **Reliability**: ✅ SATISFACTORY
- Error handling patterns established
- State management approach defined
- Recovery mechanisms specified (form reset, modal closure)

#### **Maintainability**: ✅ EXCELLENT
- Clear component separation and file organization
- Comprehensive documentation and code standards
- Established testing patterns and coverage requirements

### **📊 FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS**

**For Development Team**:
1. Address priority calculation race condition before backend implementation
2. Create comprehensive error handling specification document
3. Implement performance monitoring from day one

**For Product Owner**:
1. Consider priority calculation edge cases in acceptance criteria
2. Validate error message specifications align with UX standards

**For Stakeholders**:
1. Story has strong foundation but needs refinement in critical areas
2. Risk is manageable with proper attention to identified concerns
3. Consider this story as "approved with conditions" rather than blocking development
