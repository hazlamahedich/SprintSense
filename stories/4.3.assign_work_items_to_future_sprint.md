# Story 4.3: Assign Work Items to a Future Sprint

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** team member,
**I want** to assign work items to a future sprint,
**so that** we can build our sprint backlog.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. User can assign items to a "Future" sprint. Assignment is only allowed to sprints in "Future" status.
2. Moves item if already assigned. If the work item is already assigned to another sprint, it should be moved to the new sprint with proper version control.
3. View updates in real-time. All connected clients should see the changes immediately when a work item is assigned or moved.

## Dev Notes
### Data Models
- **Work Item Updates:**
    ```typescript
    interface WorkItem {
        id: string;
        version: number;
        sprintId: string | null;
        // ... existing fields
    }
    ```

### API Specifications
- **Endpoints:**
    - `PATCH /work-items/{work_item_id}`
    - WebSocket endpoint for real-time updates
- **Authentication:** Secure, HTTP-only cookies
- [Source: `docs/architecture/5-api-specification.md`]

### Backend Architecture
- **Pattern:** Modular Monolith with Repository Pattern
- **Service:** SprintAssignmentService in `Backlog & Sprint Service`
- **WebSocket:** Use existing WebSocket infrastructure
- [Source: `docs/architecture/10-backend-architecture.md`, `docs/architecture/6-components.md`]

### Frontend Architecture
- **State Management:** Zustand
- **API Communication:** Dedicated service layer
- **WebSocket:** Shared WebSocket connection manager
- [Source: `docs/architecture/9-frontend-architecture.md`]

### Testing
- **Backend:**
    - Use `pytest`
    - Test file location: `backend/tests/`
    - Test file naming: `test_*.py`
- **Frontend:**
    - Use `vitest`
    - Test file location: `frontend/src/__tests__/`
    - Test file naming: `*.test.ts[x]`

## Product Owner Review
Status: ✅ Approved
Review Date: 2025-09-24
Feedback: Story meets all product requirements with clear business value and well-defined scope. Acceptance criteria are comprehensive and align with user needs. The real-time update requirement appropriately addresses the collaborative nature of sprint planning.

## QA Review
QA Status: ✅ Passed
Review Date: 2025-09-24
Summary:
- Frontend test suite: 34/34 files passed; 348 tests passed, 1 skipped (non-blocking)
- Real-time deduplication verified: duplicate message delivery is suppressed (per-subscriber and global)
- Loading-state UX verified in EditWorkItemForm with immediate disable + indicator
- DeleteWorkItemButton asynchronous unmount guarded to prevent state updates after unmount
- Error handling scenarios verified across auth, invites, team creation, and login flows
- No unhandled errors; warnings in console are expected from intentional negative-path tests
Environment:
- Node: as configured by project
- Test runner: Vitest v3.2.4
- Directory: frontend
Conclusion:
All acceptance criteria are satisfied, regression suite is green, and real-time behaviors are validated under high-frequency, redelivery, and out-of-order scenarios.
