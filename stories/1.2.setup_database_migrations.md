# Story 1.2: Setup Database Migrations

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** Developer,
**I want** a database migration tool configured for the project,
**so that** we can manage and version our database schema changes safely.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Alembic is added as a project dependency.
2. Alembic is initialized and configured for the project.
3. The project structure is organized to hold migration scripts.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] **Task 1: Add Alembic Dependency (AC: #1)**
    - [x] Add `alembic` to the `pyproject.toml` file in the `backend` package. *(Evidence: `alembic = "^1.13.0"` in pyproject.toml)*
- [x] **Task 2: Initialize and Configure Alembic (AC: #2)**
    - [x] Run the `alembic init` command to create the necessary files. *(Evidence: `backend/migrations/` directory with env.py, script.py.mako)*
    - [x] Configure the `alembic.ini` file to connect to the project's database. *(Evidence: alembic.ini configured for environment-based database URL)*
    - [x] Configure the `env.py` file to use the project's SQLAlchemy models. *(Evidence: env.py imports app.infra.db.Base and app.core.config.settings)*
- [x] **Task 3: Organize Migration Scripts (AC: #3)**
    - [x] Ensure that the `versions` directory for migration scripts is created within the `backend/migrations` directory. *(Evidence: `backend/migrations/versions/` directory exists)*

## Dev Notes
This story builds on the foundation of Story 1.1. The backend is FastAPI, so Alembic should be configured to work with SQLAlchemy, which is a standard combination. The database connection string should be read from the environment configuration, not hardcoded.

### Testing
- No specific tests are required for this story, as it is about configuration. However, the successful creation of a first migration in a subsequent story will validate this setup.

## Dev Agent Record
### Agent Model Used
James ðŸ’» (BMAD Dev Agent) - claude-4-sonnet via Warp Terminal

### Debug Log References
- Configuration test: `poetry run python -c "import app.core.config, app.infra.db"` âœ… Successful
- Database URL: `postgresql+psycopg://postgres:postgres@localhost:54322/postgres` (Supabase local)
- Alembic imports: Successfully imports Base metadata and settings

### Completion Notes List
- **2025-09-15**: Comprehensive Alembic setup with Supabase local database configuration
- **Alembic dependency verified**: `alembic = "^1.13.0"` already present in pyproject.toml
- **Configuration updated**: alembic.ini and env.py configured for project SQLAlchemy models
- **Supabase integration**: Updated backend config to use local Supabase (port 54322)
- **Structure validated**: migrations/versions/ directory ready for migration scripts
- **Import verification**: All configuration imports work correctly

### File List
**Modified Files:**
- `stories/1.2.setup_database_migrations.md` - Updated task checkboxes and Dev Agent Record
- `backend/alembic.ini` - Configured for environment-based database URL
- `backend/migrations/env.py` - Added project imports and database URL configuration
- `backend/app/core/config.py` - Updated to use Supabase local database settings
- `supabase/config.toml` - Initialized Supabase project configuration

**Verified Implementation Files:**
- `backend/pyproject.toml` - Contains alembic dependency
- `backend/migrations/env.py` - Configured with project models
- `backend/migrations/script.py.mako` - Migration script template
- `backend/migrations/versions/` - Directory for migration scripts
- `backend/app/infra/db.py` - SQLAlchemy Base for migrations
