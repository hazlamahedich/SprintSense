## Dev Notes

### Business Context & Algorithm Design
[Source: docs/prd/6-epic-details.md#Epic3Story2 + Story 3.1 Implementation Insights]

**Business Value Proposition:**
- **Problem**: Teams struggle with manual prioritization leading to suboptimal backlog ordering
- **Solution**: AI-driven scoring based on strategic goal alignment provides objective prioritization foundation
- **Success Metrics**: Reduce time-to-prioritize by 60%, increase goal alignment accuracy by 40%
- **User Journey Integration**: Enables Stories 3.3 (Review/Apply Suggestions) and 3.4 (Epic Clustering)

**Core Scoring Algorithm Requirements:**
- **Text Matching**: Use keyword extraction from work item titles/descriptions against project goal descriptions
- **Priority Weighting**: Incorporate priority_weight field (1-10) from project goals as multiplication factor
- **Scoring Range**: Output scores from 0.0 to 10.0 for consistent ranking
- **Tie-Breaking**: Use work item priority field as secondary sort criteria
- **Transparency**: Include explainability data for user trust and decision validation

**Text Processing Pipeline (from Story 3.1):**
1. HTML stripping for rich text goal descriptions
2. Text normalization (lowercase, whitespace cleanup)
3. Keyword extraction (meaningful terms, domain-specific preservation)
4. Stop word removal and stemming for better matching
5. Minimum 10 character requirement for meaningful analysis

**Algorithm Specification (FIXED by QA Review):**
```
// Defensive normalization with bounds checking
if Total_Goal_Keywords == 0: Base_Score = 0
else: Base_Score = min(10.0, (Keyword_Match_Count / Total_Goal_Keywords) * Goal_Priority_Weight)

// Work item priority normalized to 0-1 scale (assumes 0-10 range, configurable)
Priority_Adjustment = (Work_Item_Priority / 10.0) * 0.5  // Max 0.5 points adjustment

// Final score bounded to specified range
Final_Score = min(10.0, Base_Score + Priority_Adjustment)

// Error Handling:
// - Division by zero protection
// - Score range enforcement (0.0 - 10.0)
// - Configurable priority scale normalization
```

### Architecture Context
[Source: docs/architecture/10-backend-architecture.md + docs/architecture/3-tech-stack.md]

**Backend Service Pattern:**
- **Framework**: FastAPI ~0.109.0 with automatic OpenAPI documentation
- **Architecture**: Modular Monolith pattern with feature-based router grouping
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 16.2 with Repository Pattern for all data access
- **Caching**: Redis 7.2 for performance optimization of goal data and results

**Service Layer Structure:**
```
app/domains/services/ai_prioritization_service.py  # Core business logic
app/api/v1/endpoints/ai_prioritization.py          # REST API endpoints
app/domains/schemas/ai_prioritization.py           # Pydantic request/response schemas
app/domains/repositories/ai_prioritization_repo.py # Data access layer
```

### Database Schema Requirements
[Source: Story 3.1 ProjectGoal model + docs/architecture/4-data-models.md patterns]

**Required Tables Access:**
- `project_goals`: For goal descriptions and priority weights
- `work_items`: For item titles, descriptions, and current priorities
- `teams`: For team association and access control

**New Caching Schema (Redis):**
```
Key Pattern: "ai_priority:goals:{team_id}"
Value: JSON array of preprocessed goal data with keywords
TTL: 1 hour (goals change infrequently)

Key Pattern: "ai_priority:scores:{team_id}:{hash_of_work_items}"
Value: JSON array of scored work item results
TTL: 10 minutes (work items change frequently)
```

### API Specifications
[Source: docs/architecture/5-api-specification.md + Story 3.1 established patterns]

**New Endpoint Design:**
```
POST /api/v1/teams/{teamId}/ai-prioritization/score
Headers:
  - Content-Type: application/json
  - Cookie: session_token (secure, HTTP-only)
Request Body: {
  "work_item_ids": ["uuid1", "uuid2", ...],  // Optional: specific items to score
  "include_metadata": boolean,                // Optional: include scoring details
  "mode": "full" | "suggestion" | "clustering" // Added: Support different workflow modes
}
Response: {
  "scored_items": [
    {
      "work_item_id": "uuid",
      "title": "string",
      "current_priority": number,
      "ai_score": number,
      "suggested_rank": number,
      "confidence_level": "high" | "medium" | "low", // Added: User confidence indicator
      "explanation": "string",                        // Added: Human-readable reasoning
      "scoring_metadata": {  // If include_metadata=true
        "matched_goals": [
          {
            "goal_id": "uuid",
            "goal_title": "string",
            "match_strength": number,
            "matched_keywords": ["keyword1", "keyword2"]
          }
        ],
        "base_score": number,
        "priority_adjustment": number,
        "clustering_similarity": number  // Added: For Story 3.4 epic clustering
      }
    }
  ],
  "total_items": number,
  "generation_time_ms": number,
  "business_metrics": {  // Added: For business value validation
    "accuracy_score": number,
    "coverage_percentage": number,
    "algorithm_version": "string"
  }
}
```

**Authentication & Authorization:**
- Follow established pattern from Story 3.1: secure HTTP-only cookies
- User must be team member to access scoring service
- Same role-based access: all team members can request scoring

### Performance Requirements
[Source: AC #4 + docs/architecture/coding-standards.md testing requirements]

**Response Time Targets:**
- **< 500ms** for teams with up to 1000 work items
- **< 100ms** for cached results (Redis hit)
- **< 200ms** for goal preprocessing (first-time team scoring)

**Performance Optimization Strategies:**
- Redis caching of preprocessed project goals (TTL: 1 hour)
- Database query optimization with proper indexes on team_id, work_item status
- Lazy loading: only process goals and work items when scoring requested
- Batch processing: score all team items in single request to minimize API calls

**Monitoring Integration:**
- OpenTelemetry instrumentation for response times
- Custom metrics for cache hit/miss ratios
- Error rate tracking for scoring algorithm failures

### Error Handling Specifications
[Added by QA Review - Critical for Production Readiness]

**Service Failure Scenarios & Responses:**

| Scenario | HTTP Status | Response Body | Fallback Behavior |
|----------|-------------|---------------|------------------|
| Redis Unavailable | 200 | Normal response | Use database-only mode, log warning |
| PostgreSQL Timeout | 503 | `{"error": "service_unavailable", "retry_after": 30}` | Return cached results if available |
| No Goals Defined | 200 | `{"scored_items": [], "warning": "no_goals_configured"}` | Return empty results with guidance |
| Malformed Work Items | 400 | `{"error": "invalid_work_items", "details": [...]}` | Skip invalid items, process valid ones |
| Text Processing Failure | 200 | Reduced metadata | Use basic title matching fallback |
| Algorithm Division by Zero | 200 | Score = 0.0 | Graceful degradation with logging |
| Memory Exhaustion | 503 | `{"error": "resource_limit", "retry_after": 60}` | Trigger circuit breaker |
| Concurrent Request Limit | 429 | `{"error": "rate_limit", "retry_after": 10}` | Queue or reject with backoff |

**Circuit Breaker Configuration:**
- **Failure Threshold**: 5 consecutive failures
- **Recovery Timeout**: 30 seconds  
- **Half-Open Test**: Single request probe
- **Metrics**: Track breaker state changes
